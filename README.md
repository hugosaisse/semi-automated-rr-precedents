## Abstract

Precedents constitute the starting point of judges' reasoning in national legal systems. Precedents are also an essential input for case-based reasoning (CBR) methodologies. Although a great deal of research has been done in CBR applied to legal practice, the precedent retrieval techniques are a relatively new and unexplored field of AI & Law. Only a few works have tested or developed methods for identifying such previous similar cases. This work uses text mining (TM), natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization methods to pro-vide a semi-automated rapid literature review and identify how justice courts and legal practitioners may use AI to retrieve similar cases. Based on Preferred Re-porting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), automa-tion techniques were used to expedite the literature review. In this work we con-firmed the feasibility of automation tools for expediting literature reviews and contribute with an overview of the current research state on legal precedents re-trieval.
