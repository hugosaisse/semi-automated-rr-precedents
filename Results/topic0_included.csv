Precedents (statements from prior cases) play an important role in The Common Law system, where lawyers need to frequently refer to relevant prior cases. Measuring document similarity is one of the most crucial aspects of any document retrieval system which decides the speed, scalability and accuracy of the system. Text-based and network-based methods for computing similarity among case reports have already been proposed in prior works but not without a few pitfalls. Since legal citation networks are generally highly disconnected, network based metrics are not suited for them. Till date, only a few text-based and predominant embedding based methods have been employed, for instance, TF-IDF based approaches, Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013) and Doc2Vec (Le and Mikolov 2014) based approaches. We investigate the performance of 56 different methodologies for computing textual similarity across court case statements when applied on a dataset of Indian Supreme Court Cases. Among the 56 different methods, thirty are adaptations of existing methods and twenty-six are our proposed methods. The methods studied include models such as BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) and Law2Vec (Ilias 2019). It is observed that the more traditional methods (such as the TF-IDF and LDA) that rely on a bag-of-words representation performs better than the more advanced context-aware methods (like BERT and Law2Vec) for computing document-level similarity. Finally we nominate, via empirical validation, five of our best performing methods as appropriate for measuring similarity between case reports. Among these five, two are adaptations of existing methods and the other three are our proposed methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer

To do this, the choice of an ideal representation is guided by the domain characteristics and the complexity of its cases. Recently, the explosion of deep learning techniques and other forms of vectorised representations, has provided a new source for case insights. Richer text features can be extracted and used for each case if required. In this paper, we build on recent work in this area and generate richer case representation by automatically acquiring domain knowledge from unstructured sentences. We describe how the Deep Knowledge Acquisition Framework obtains its representation vectors from stemmed words and improving these vectors iteratively, suggesting high quality outputs and relevance to domain experts based on either explicit queries or their past intentions. We evaluate these ideas using two, not related, datasets from the automotive and legal domains respectively.

Our approach was to investigate the effectiveness of using legal catchphrases in precedence retrieval. To improve retrieval performance, we incorporated term dependency in our retrieval. In addition, we investigate the effects of deploying query expansion on the retrieval performance. Our results show an improvement in the retrieval performance when we incorporate term dependence in scoring and ranking prior cases.

This paper proposes an automatic catchphrases prediction for cases for the same.

It is difficult, however, if not impossible to define principles in an intensional manner so that they may be applied deductively. The problem is the gap between the abstract, open-textured principles and concrete facts. On the other hand, when expert decision-makers rationalize their conclusions in specific cases, they often link principles to the specific facts of the cases. In effect, these expert-defined associations between principles and facts provide extensional definitions of the principles. The experts operationalize the abstract principles by linking them to the facts. This paper discusses research in which the following hypothesis was empirically tested: extensionally defined principles, as well as cited past cases, can help in predicting the principles and cases that might be relevant in the analysis of new cases. To investigate this phenomenon computationally, a large set of professional ethics cases was analyzed and a computational model called SIROCCO, a system for retrieving principles and past cases, was constructed. Empirical evidence is presented that the operationalization information contained in extensionally defined principles can be leveraged to predict the principles and past cases that are relevant to new problem situations. This is shown through an ablation experiment, comparing SIROCCO to a version of itself that does not employ operationalization information. Further, it is shown that SIROCCO's extensionally defined principles and case citations help it to outperform a full-text retrieval program that does not employ such information. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Our system utilizes documents of closed lawsuits as training data for generating keyword-based and case-based classification criteria, and applies these machine-generated criteria for the classification tasks. To construct databases of the classification criteria, we employ different levels of lexical knowledge in extracting information from legal documents in Chinese, and build a case instance for each closed lawsuit. Experimental results indicate that case-based classification outperforms keyword-based classification, and that machine-generated cases may offer performance accuracy that is about 7% below that of human-provided cases. Hoping to boost inference efficiency of our classifiers, we also design methods that merge the machine-generated criteria. Empirical results show that our methods can maintain the classification quality within 20% of the quality achieved by human-provided cases, even when we aggressively reduce the number of previously machine-generated cases by about seventy percents.",case classification; case clustering; case-based reasoning; chinese legal information system; k-nearest neighbor; rule-based reasoning,"Liu, C.-L.; National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan",,,1581137478; 9781581137477,Conference Paper,Scopus,N.A.,N.A.,China,classification and clustering for casebased criminal summary judgments,10114510477881047840,we investigate the effectiveness of machinegenerated criteria for classification problems related to criminal summary judgments our system utilizes documents of closed lawsuits as training data for generating keywordbased and casebased classification criteria and applies these machinegenerated criteria for the classification tasks to construct databases of the classification criteria we employ different levels of lexical knowledge in extracting information from legal documents in chinese and build a case instance for each closed lawsuit experimental results indicate that casebased classification outperforms keywordbased classification and that machinegenerated cases may offer performance accuracy that is about 7 below that of humanprovided cases hoping to boost inference efficiency of our classifiers we also design methods that merge the machinegenerated criteria empirical results show that our methods can maintain the classification quality within 20 of the quality achieved by humanprovided cases even when we aggressively reduce the number of previously machinegenerated cases by about seventy percents,case classification case clustering casebased reasoning chinese legal information system knearest neighbor rulebased reasoning,classification clustering casebased crim summary judgment,investigat effectivenes machinegenerated crit classification probl related crim summary judgment syst utiliz document closed lawsuit training dat generating keywordbased casebased classification crit appli machinegenerated crit classification task construct databas classification crit employ different level lexic knowledg extracting information legal document chines build cas instanc closed lawsuit experiment result indicat casebased classification outperform keywordbased classification machinegenerated cas may off performanc accuracy humanprovided cas hoping boost inferenc efficiency classifi als design method merg machinegenerated crit empiric result show method maintain classification quality within quality achieved humanprovided cas even aggressively reduc numb previously machinegenerated cas seventy percent,cas classification cas clustering casebased reasoning chines legal information syst knearest neighb rulebased reasoning,investigat effectivenes machinegenerated crit classification probl related crim summary judgment syst utiliz document closed lawsuit training dat generating keywordbased casebased classification crit appli machinegenerated crit classification task construct databas classification crit employ different level lexic knowledg extracting information legal document chines build cas instanc closed lawsuit experiment result indicat casebased classification outperform keywordbased classification machinegenerated cas may off performanc accuracy humanprovided cas hoping boost inferenc efficiency classifi als design method merg machinegenerated crit empiric result show method maintain classification quality within quality achieved humanprovided cas even aggressively reduc numb previously machinegenerated cas seventy percent classification clustering casebased crim summary judgment cas classification cas clustering casebased reasoning chines legal information syst knearest neighb rulebased reasoning
