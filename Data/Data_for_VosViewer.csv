It is difficult, however, if not impossible to define principles in an intensional manner so that they may be applied deductively. The problem is the gap between the abstract, open-textured principles and concrete facts. On the other hand, when expert decision-makers rationalize their conclusions in specific cases, they often link principles to the specific facts of the cases. In effect, these expert-defined associations between principles and facts provide extensional definitions of the principles. The experts operationalize the abstract principles by linking them to the facts. This paper discusses research in which the following hypothesis was empirically tested: extensionally defined principles, as well as cited past cases, can help in predicting the principles and cases that might be relevant in the analysis of new cases. To investigate this phenomenon computationally, a large set of professional ethics cases was analyzed and a computational model called SIROCCO, a system for retrieving principles and past cases, was constructed. Empirical evidence is presented that the operationalization information contained in extensionally defined principles can be leveraged to predict the principles and past cases that are relevant to new problem situations. This is shown through an ablation experiment, comparing SIROCCO to a version of itself that does not employ operationalization information. Further, it is shown that SIROCCO's extensionally defined principles and case citations help it to outperform a full-text retrieval program that does not employ such information. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

To alleviate this problem, we propose algorithms for automatically generating and refining case instances from real-world judgment documents for criminal summary judgments. Our algorithms attempt to extract important legal information from the documents of past lawsuits to build case instances, and then refine these case instances by merging similar cases and removing relatively irrelevant information from the cases. Experimental results, obtained from applying the resulting cases to classifying real-world lawsuits, indicate that our algorithms are viable for assisting the task of building case databases for case-based legal reasoning systems.",Artificial intelligence; Case-based reasoning; Chinese legal information system; Rule-based reasoning; Text mining; Weighted k-nearest neighbor,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Database systems; Indexing (of information); Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Legacy systems; Case-based reasoning; Chinese legal information system; Rule-based reasoning; Weighted k-nearest neighbor; Information science,"http://wjirs.judicial.gov.tw/jirs/; http://www.ly.gov.tw/; http://www.moj.gov.tw/; http://www.lawbank.com.tw/; http://www.ordos.nm.cn/haoxia/navigation/zhengfa.htm; Aleven, V., Teaching Case-based Argumentation Through a Model and Examples, , Ph.D. Dissertation, Intelligent Systems Program, University of Pittsburgh, U.S.A; Branting, L.K., Lester, J., Callaway, C., Automating judicial document drafting: A discourse-based approach (1998) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 6, pp. 111-149; Brown, G., CHINATAX: Exploring isomorphism with Chinese law (1993) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 175-179; Brüninghaus, S., Ashley, K.D., Toward adding knowledge to learning algorithms for indexing legal cases (1999) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 9-17; Brüninghaus, S., Ashley, K.D., Improving the representation of legal case texts with information extraction methods (2001) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 42-51; Cammelli, A., Socci, F., A thesaurus for improving information retrieval in an integrated legal expert system (1998) Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 619-624; Chang, C.T., Ho, J.H., Liu, C.L., Decision support for criminal summary judgment (2002) Proceedings of the TAAI 7th Conference on AI and Applications, pp. 178-183; Chen, C.S., Legal informatics in Germany (2001) China Law Journal, 46, pp. 79-85; Cost, S., Salzberg, S., A weighted nearest neighbor algorithm for learning with symbolic features (1993) Machine Learning, 10, pp. 57-78; Hafner, C., Berman, D., The role of context in case-based legal reasoning: Teleological, temporal and procedural (2002) Artificial and Law, 10, pp. 19-64; Hirschberg, D.S., Algorithms for the longest common subsequence problem (1997) Journal of the ACM, 24, pp. 664-675; http://www.keenage.com; Lai, T.B.Y., Huang, C., Dependency-based syntactic analysis of Chinese and annotation of parsed corpus (2000) Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 255-262; Leake, D.B., (1996) Case-based Reasoning, , MIT Press; Legrand, J., A contribution to indexing in legal information retrieval (1997) Proceedings of the 8th Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 213-218; Liu, C.L., Chang, C.T., Some case-refinement strategies for case-based criminal summary judgments (2003) Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, 2871, pp. 285-291; Liu, C.L., Chang, C.T., Ho, J.H., Classification and clustering for case-based criminal summary judgments (2003) Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 252-261; Manning, C.D., Schütze, H., (1999) Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, , MIT Press; Merkl, D., Schweighofer, E., Winiwarter, W., Exploratory analysis of concept and document spaces with connectionist networks (1999) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 7, pp. 185-209; Moens, M.F., Uyttendaele, C., Dumortier, J., Abstracting of legal cases: The SALOMON experience (1997) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 114-122; Pannu, A.S., Using genetic algorithms to inductively reason with cases in the legal domain (1995) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 175-184; Schild, U.J., Intelligent computer systems for criminal sentencing (1995) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 229-238; Thompson, P., Automatic categorization of case law (2001) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 70-77; Weber, R., Intelligent jurisprudence research: A new concept (1999) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 164-172; Wu, C.W., Liu, C.L., Ontology-based text summarization for business news articles (2003) Proceedings of the ISCA 18th International Conference on Computers and Their Applications, pp. 389-392","Liu, C.-L.; Department of Computer Science, , Taipei, 116, Taiwan; email: chaolin@nccu.edu.tw",,,10162364,,JINEE,,English,J.

The KE approach is grounded in artificial intelligence (AI) and case-based reasoning (CBR), whilst the NLP approach is associated with open domain statistical retrieval. We provide some original arguments regarding the focus on KE-based retrieval in the past and why this is not sustainable in the long term. Legal approaches to questioning (NLP), rather than arguing (CBR), are proposed as the appropriate jurisprudential and cognitive underpinning for legal IR. Recall within the context of precision is proposed as a better fit to law than the 'total recall' model of the past, wherein conceptual and contextual search are combined to improve retrieval performance for both parties in a dispute. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

Ontology, an emerging research topic in recent years, incorporates a hierarchical structure and supports logical reasoning, which can reduce semantic ambiguities and extract implied semantic information. We constructed statutes ontology and a case ontology using a bottom-up method and a top-down method, respectively. Then, to test the retrieval precision of the proposed CLCS, we performed experiments using emotional damage compensation as an example by combining genetic algorithm and k-nearest neighbor approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves retrieval precision. © 2013 IEEE.",Case similarity; google distance; legal ontology; legal retrieval; semantic recognition,Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Semantics; Case similarity; Google distances; Legal ontology; Legal Retrieval; Semantic recognition; Ontology,"Noy, N.F., Hafner, C.D., The state of the art in ontology design: A survey and comparative review (1997) AI Mag., 18 (3), pp. 53-74; Valente, A., Types and roles of legal ontologies (2005) Law and the Semantic Web: Legal Ontologies, Methodologies, Legal Information Retrieval, and Applications (Lecture Notes in Computer Science), pp. 65-76. , V.

Our system utilizes documents of closed lawsuits as training data for generating keyword-based and case-based classification criteria, and applies these machine-generated criteria for the classification tasks. To construct databases of the classification criteria, we employ different levels of lexical knowledge in extracting information from legal documents in Chinese, and build a case instance for each closed lawsuit. Experimental results indicate that case-based classification outperforms keyword-based classification, and that machine-generated cases may offer performance accuracy that is about 7% below that of human-provided cases. Hoping to boost inference efficiency of our classifiers, we also design methods that merge the machine-generated criteria. Empirical results show that our methods can maintain the classification quality within 20% of the quality achieved by human-provided cases, even when we aggressively reduce the number of previously machine-generated cases by about seventy percents.",case classification; case clustering; case-based reasoning; chinese legal information system; k-nearest neighbor; rule-based reasoning,Case classification; case clustering; chinese legal information system; K-nearest neighbors; Rule based reasoning; Artificial intelligence; Crime; Information retrieval systems; Information systems; Machine design; Case based reasoning,"http://wjirs.judicial.gov.tw/jirs/, The following websites provide legal information for Taiwan and China as of May 20, 2003.

Given a situation that can lead to filing a case, the precedent retrieval task aims at finding case documents where similar legal situations were addressed. The statute retrieval task aims at finding relevant statutes that are applicable to the situation.

Precedents (statements from prior cases) play an important role in The Common Law system, where lawyers need to frequently refer to relevant prior cases. Measuring document similarity is one of the most crucial aspects of any document retrieval system which decides the speed, scalability and accuracy of the system. Text-based and network-based methods for computing similarity among case reports have already been proposed in prior works but not without a few pitfalls. Since legal citation networks are generally highly disconnected, network based metrics are not suited for them. Till date, only a few text-based and predominant embedding based methods have been employed, for instance, TF-IDF based approaches, Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013) and Doc2Vec (Le and Mikolov 2014) based approaches. We investigate the performance of 56 different methodologies for computing textual similarity across court case statements when applied on a dataset of Indian Supreme Court Cases. Among the 56 different methods, thirty are adaptations of existing methods and twenty-six are our proposed methods. The methods studied include models such as BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) and Law2Vec (Ilias 2019). It is observed that the more traditional methods (such as the TF-IDF and LDA) that rely on a bag-of-words representation performs better than the more advanced context-aware methods (like BERT and Law2Vec) for computing document-level similarity. Finally we nominate, via empirical validation, five of our best performing methods as appropriate for measuring similarity between case reports. Among these five, two are adaptations of existing methods and the other three are our proposed methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",BERT; Court case reports; Court case similarity; Doc2vec; Law2vec; Legal information retrieval; Topic modeling; Word2vec,Artificial intelligence; Management; Citation networks; Document similarity; Empirical validation; Legal documents; Legal information retrieval; Measuring similarities; Textual similarities; Unsupervised approaches; Information retrieval,"Learning robust, transferable sentence representations for text classification (2018) Corr Abs/1810.00681, 1810, p. 00681; Etc: Encoding long and structured inputs in transformers (2020) Arxiv2004.08483; Backstrom, L., Kleinberg, J., Romantic partnerships and the dispersion of social ties: A network analysis of relationship status on facebook (2014) Proc.

In making decisions, Judges are obliged to consult prior cases that had already been decided to ensure that there is no divergence in treatment of similar situations in different cases. Our approach was to investigate the effectiveness of using legal catchphrases in precedence retrieval. To improve retrieval performance, we incorporated term dependency in our retrieval. In addition, we investigate the effects of deploying query expansion on the retrieval performance. Our results show an improvement in the retrieval performance when we incorporate term dependence in scoring and ranking prior cases.

Traditional Nearest-Neighbour (NN) matching has shown that it is not capable of dealing with the situations that the values of weights or dimensional matching scores are extremely high or low. These extreme situations have nonlinear psychological effects on the aggregate marching scores. Generalized Nearest-Neighbour (GNN) matching improved NN matching in certain situations, but it is not generally applicable and it can cause an unexpected ranking. In order to improve the limitation of NN matching and complement the deficiency of GNN matching, we propose a novel Nonlinear Nearest-Neighbour (NNN) matching function based on the adjustments for nonlinear effects and the fuzzy logic inference.

To do this, the choice of an ideal representation is guided by the domain characteristics and the complexity of its cases. Recently, the explosion of deep learning techniques and other forms of vectorised representations, has provided a new source for case insights. Richer text features can be extracted and used for each case if required. In this paper, we build on recent work in this area and generate richer case representation by automatically acquiring domain knowledge from unstructured sentences. We describe how the Deep Knowledge Acquisition Framework obtains its representation vectors from stemmed words and improving these vectors iteratively, suggesting high quality outputs and relevance to domain experts based on either explicit queries or their past intentions. We evaluate these ideas using two, not related, datasets from the automotive and legal domains respectively. The results show the benefits of combining Autoencoders and Siamese Networks in CBR while achieving better textual data dimensionality reduction, data de-noising and similarity measures. © 2019 IEEE.",Autoencoders; Case-based Reasoning; Deep Learning; Multi-lingual Text Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Siamese Networks; Textual CBR,Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Autoencoders; Case representation; Data de-noising; Domain knowledge; Learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Similarity measure; Text analysis; Case based reasoning,"Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 1 (7). , March; Jalali, V., Leake, D., CBR meets big data: A case study of large-scale adaptation rule generation (2015) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, pp. 181-196; Daengdej, J., Lukose, D., Tsui, E., Beinat, P., Prophet, L., Dynamically creating indices for two million cases: A real world problem (1996) Advances in Case-Based Reasoning, p. 105119. , Berlin, Springer; Beaver, I., Dumoulin, J., Applying mapreduce to learning user preferences in near realtime (2014) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, ICCBR 2014, p. 1528. , Berlin, Springer; Plaza, E., Semantics and experience in the future web (2008) Proceedings of the Ninth European Conference on Case-Based Reasoning, p. 4458. , Springer; Ontanon, S., Lee, Y.C., Snodgrass, S., Bonfiglio, D., Winston, F., Mc-Donald, C., Gonzalez, A., Case-based prediction of teen driver behavior and skill (2014) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, ICCBR 2014, p. 375389. , Berlin, Springer; Cordier, A., Lefevre, M., Champin, P.A., Georgeon, O., Mille, A., Tracebased reasoning modeling interaction traces for reasoning on experiences (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Florida AI Research Symposium, p. 363368. , AAAI Press; Amin, K., Kapetanakis, S., Althoff, K.D., Dengel, A., Petridis, M., Answering with cases: A cbr approach to deep learning (2018) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development.

IRS reduces the efforts of identifying the required information from an enormous database. Legal domain is one of the major producers of complex information which consist of semi-structured and unstructured data. Knowledge based legal information systems are revolutionizing all processes involved in this domain and hence need for more effective legal knowledge management approaches are increasing. This paper proposes association rule mining as knowledge extraction technique that can be used effectively for analyzing relatedness of documents in legal domain. Through this work, authors present their efforts in analyzing similarity in legal documents from the citations done in court judgement by applying Association rule mining. © International Research Publication House.",Association rule mining; Case similarity analysis; Citation analysis; Knowledge management; Legal domain,,"Lee, K., Azyndar, S., Mattson, I., A New Era: Integrating Todays Next Gen Research Tools Ravel and Casetext in the Law School Classroom (2015) SSRN Electronic Journal; Byrd, O., Legal Analytics Vs.

As number of cases are increasing rapidly, automation becomes highly desirable. This paper presents two such systems viz. Automatic Catchphrase Detection and Automatic Precedence Detection. Automatic Catchphrase Detection: One of the key requirements of such information retrieval system is to pre-populate database of prior cases with catchphrases for better indexing and faster, relevant retrieval. This paper proposes an automatic catchphrases prediction for cases for the same. The problem catchphrase detection has been modeled as ""custom named entity recognition (NER) using conditional random fields (CRF)"". CRF is trained with pairs of prior cases and their respective catchphrases, the gold standards. The model is, then used to predict catch-phases of unseen legal texts. End of the first section demonstrates efficacy of the proposed system using practical data-set. Automatic Precedence Detection: Due to thousands of past cases it becomes tedious and error-prone to find relevant precedent, manually. An automatic precedent retrieval system is the need of the hour. One of the key requirements of such information system is to find cases which could be ""similar"" to the case in hand. The ""similarity"" used in this paper is about citations. The problem is of predicting prior cases which could potentially be cited by a particular case text. This paper proposes such association system using mixed approaches. It employs rule-based Regular Expressions based on references to statute and Articles. It finds cosine similar ity between case susing vector sgenerated by popular word embedding called doc2vec. It also leverages topic modeling by finding matches between cases based on the number of common topic words. End of the second section demonstrates efficacy of the proposed system by generating cite-able documents from test data-set.",Conditional random fields; Information retrieval; Legal; Legal; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Regular expressions; Text mining; Topic modeling; Word embedding; Word2Vec,Character recognition; Computer programming languages; Data mining; Forecasting; Information retrieval; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Pattern matching; Random processes; Statistical tests; Text processing; Conditional random field; Legal; Named entity recognition; Regular expressions; Text mining; Topic Modeling; Word embedding; Word2Vec; Search engines,"Edward Loper Bird, S., Klein, E., (2009) Natural Language Toolkit, , http://www.nltk.org/, Sep 2009; (2017) Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, , https://sites.google.com/view/fire2017irled/track-description, IRSI Information Retrival Society of India.

It is urgently necessary for Japanese judiciary to adopt ICT to catch up with the global trend. For example, since almost all judicial records are stored as printed material, it is difficult to access them. Recently, limited number of record are opened on web site. UI for retrieving is not well designed for ordinary people. For example, they cannot search precedents with thing in action and what to prove to win. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose an intelligent precedent retrieval system that uses ontology. It allows users to find precedents with thing in action and similarity of documents. Also, it suggests appropriate laws and what to prove. In other words, our system can support user’s prosecution. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",Civil trial; Cyber court; High tech court; Legal document; Ontology; Precedent retrieval system; Semantic web; XML,Ontology; Semantic Web; System theory; XML; Civil trial; Cyber court; High tech; Legal documents; Retrieval systems; Information retrieval,"William & Mary Law School, , http://law.wm.edu/academics/intellectuallife/researchcenters/clct/; Singapore Supreme Court, , http://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=361#10; (2014) JURISIN, p. 2013. , Japan, October; Kasahara, T., Cybercourt - Court technology.
