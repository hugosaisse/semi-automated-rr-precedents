In this paper we put forward a formal model of reasoning with cases which captures many of the insights from that previous work. We begin by stating our view of reasoning with cases as a process of constructing, evaluating and applying a theory. Central to our model is a view of the relationship between cases, rules based on cases, and the social values which justify those rules. Having given our view of these relationships, we present our formal model of them, and explain how theories can be constructed, compared and evaluated. We then show how previous work can be described in terms of our model, and discuss extensions to the basic model to accommodate particular features of previous work. We conclude by identifying some directions for future work. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In order to interpret and apply rules containing such terms, appeal must be made to their previous constructions, as in the interpretation of legal statutes through relevant legal cases. We describe a system CABARET (CAse-BAsed REasoning Tool) that provides a domain-independent shell that integrates reasoning with rules and reasoning with previous cases in order to apply rules containing ill-defined terms. The integration of these two reasoning paradigms is performed via a collection of control heuristics, which suggest how to interleave case-based methods and rule-based methods to construct an argument to support a particular interpretation. CABARET is currently instantiated with cases and rules from an area of income tax law, the so-called ""home office deduction"". An example of CABARET's processing of an actual tax case is provided in some detail. The advantages of CABARET's hybrid approach to interpretation stem from the synergy derived from interleaving case-based and rule-based tasks. © 1991.",,,"Rissland, E.L.; Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, United States",,,00207373,,IJMMB,,"English","Int.

After giving a legal-theoretical account of judicial reasoning with precedents, a formal method is proposed for representing precedents and it is discussed how such representations can be used in a formally defined dialectical protocol for dispute. The basic ideas are to represent cases as argument structures (including pro and con arguments, and the arguments for adjudicating their conflicts) and to define certain case-based reasoning moves as strategies for introducing information into a dispute. In particular, analogizing and distinguishing are conceived as elementary theory construction moves, which produce new information on the basis of an existing stock of cases. The approach also offers the possibility of using portions of precedents and of expressing criteria for determining the outcome of precedent-based disputes. The analysis, which is partly based on argument-based semantics of defeasible reasoning, has two aims. The first is to provide a formalization of certain aspects of legal theories unjudicial reasoning and judge-made law, and the second is to provide formal foundations for certain aspects of computer programs for case-based reasoning in the legal domain.","Case-based reasoning; Defeasible argumentation; Normative dialectics; Precedents","Computational grammars; Decision making; Formal logic; Game theory; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Mathematical models; Case-based reasoning; Defeasible argumentation; Formal dialogue game; Normative dialectics; Artificial intelligence",,,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",09248463,,AINLE,,"English","Artif Intell Law",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032309788

However, these models have not accounted for the ways that attorneys use middle-level normative background knowledge (1) to organize multi-case arguments, (2) to reason about the significance of differences between cases, and (3) to assess the relevance of precedent cases to a given problem situation. We present a novel model, that accounts for these argumentation phenomena. An evaluation study showed that arguments about the significance of distinctions based on this model help predict the outcome of cases in the area of trade secrets law, confirming the quality of these arguments. The model forms the basis of an intelligent learning environment called CATO, which was designed to help beginning law students acquire basic argumentation skills. CATO uses the model for a number of purposes, including the dynamic generation of argumentation examples. In a second evaluation study, carried out in the context of an actual legal writing course, we compared instruction with CATO against the best traditional legal writing instruction. The results indicate that CATO's example-based instructional approach is effective in teaching basic argumentation skills. However, a more ""integrated"" approach appears to be needed if students are to achieve better transfer of these skills to more complex contexts.

The program attempts to automatically classify textual descriptions of the facts of legal problems in terms of Factors, a set of classification concepts that capture stereotypical fact patterns that effect the strength of a legal claim, here trade secret misappropriation. Using these classifications, the program can evaluate and explain predictions about a problem's outcome given a database of previously classified cases.

GREBE can apply either rule-based reasoning or case-based reasoning to goals at any level of its analysis. GREBE uses an approach to case-based reasoning in which new cases are compared with the smallest collections of precedent facts that justified an individual inference step in the explanation of a precedent case. This enables knowledge of the interactions among individual inference steps in a precedent to be used in case comparison. Case comparison is also assisted by an expressive semantic network representation of case facts. Techniques are presented for retrieving and comparing cases represented in this formalism.

It is difficult, however, if not impossible to define principles in an intensional manner so that they may be applied deductively. The problem is the gap between the abstract, open-textured principles and concrete facts. On the other hand, when expert decision-makers rationalize their conclusions in specific cases, they often link principles to the specific facts of the cases. In effect, these expert-defined associations between principles and facts provide extensional definitions of the principles. The experts operationalize the abstract principles by linking them to the facts. This paper discusses research in which the following hypothesis was empirically tested: extensionally defined principles, as well as cited past cases, can help in predicting the principles and cases that might be relevant in the analysis of new cases. To investigate this phenomenon computationally, a large set of professional ethics cases was analyzed and a computational model called SIROCCO, a system for retrieving principles and past cases, was constructed. Empirical evidence is presented that the operationalization information contained in extensionally defined principles can be leveraged to predict the principles and past cases that are relevant to new problem situations. This is shown through an ablation experiment, comparing SIROCCO to a version of itself that does not employ operationalization information. Further, it is shown that SIROCCO's extensionally defined principles and case citations help it to outperform a full-text retrieval program that does not employ such information. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Resolving these disputes through the court system is both a time-and cost-consuming process. The outcome of construction litigation is normally affected by a large number of complex and interrelated factors and therefore is very difficult to predict. Methods to predict the outcome of construction litigation are not available today because this decision carries very big risks. In this study, case-based reasoning (CBR) is used to predict the outcome of construction litigation tried in Illinois circuit courts. These circuit court cases are organized in 43 input features and 1 output feature. If CBR systems such as the one developed in this study (prediction rate 83%) are available to the parties before they litigate, legal expenses could be avoided, and considerable time could be saved.",,"Construction industry; Decision making; Laws and legislation; Case based reasoning; Construction litigation; Computer aided engineering","Arditi, D.; Department of Civil Engineering, , Chicago, IL 60616, United States",,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",10939687,,CCIEF,,"English","Comput.-Aided Civ.

Construction accidents tend to cause serious damages, injuries, fatalities, and work interruptions, and provoke disputes among the involved parties. One useful means for resolving the dispute through alternative dispute resolution, instead of costly litigation, is to find similar accidents occurring in the past in the same jurisdiction and compare their similarities and differences. This paper introduces a research project on the effective retrieval of relevant historical cases from a case library using text mining techniques. Research issues in the text mining process, especially how to represent the unstructured textual cases by a structured term vector model, are investigated. It is concluded that natural language based case document retrieval is superior to the case-based reasoning from structured case collection and is more practical for implementation in a construction management information system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

All Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) employs some methods for generalizing from cases to support indexing and relevance assessment and evidences two basic inference methods: constraining search by tracing a solution from a past case or evaluating a case by comparing it to past cases. Across domains and tasks, however, humans reason with cases in subtly different ways evidencing different mixes of and mechanisms for these components. In recent CBR research in Artificial Intelligence (AI), five paradigmatic approaches have emerged: statistically-oriented, model-based, planning/design-oriented, exemplar-based, and adversarial or precedent-based. The paradigms differ in the assumptions they make about domain models, the extent to which they support symbolic case comparison, and the kinds of inferences for which they employ cases. Reasoning with cases is important in legal practice of all kinds, and legal practice involves a wide variety of case-based tasks and methods. The paradigms' respective benefits and costs suggest different approaches for different legal tasks. CBR research and development in the field of AI and Law should be pursued vigoriously for several reasons. CBR can supplement rule-based expert systems, improving their abilities to reason about statutory predicates, solve problems efficiently, and explain their results. CBR can also contribute to the design of intelligent legal data retrieval systems and improve legal document assembly programs.

This is done through the use of Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to replicate the contrasting views involved in the actual decision. This reconstruction suggests that the reasoning involved can be separated into three distinct levels: factual and normative levels and a level connecting the two, with conclusions at one level forming premises at the next. We begin by summarising our general approach, which uses instantiations of an argumentation scheme to provide presumptive justifications for actions, and critical questions to identify arguments which attack these justifications. These arguments and attacks are organised into argumentation frameworks to identify the status of individual arguments. We then discuss the levels of reasoning that occur in this reconstruction and the properties and significance of each of these levels. We illustrate the different levels with short examples and also include a discussion of the role of precedents within these levels of reasoning. © Springer 2006.","Argumentation; Case based reasoning; Intermediate legal concepts; Legal decision making; Practical reasoning; Teleological reasoning","Decision making; Information analysis; Laws and legislation; Argumentation; Case based reasoning; Intermediate legal concepts; Legal decision making; Practical reasoning; Teleological reasoning; Information science","Atkinson, K.; Department of Computer Science, , Liverpool, L69 3BX, United Kingdom",,,09248463,,AINLE,,"English","Artif Intell Law",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746873723

By failing to distinguish between features that support and oppose the predicted outcome, we argue, such explanations are not only less informative than might be expected, but also potentially misleading. To address this issue, we present an evidential approach to explanation in which a key role is played by techniques for the discovery of features that support or oppose the predicted outcome. Often in assessing the evidence provided by a continuous attribute, the problem is where to ""draw the line* between values that support and oppose the predicted outcome. Our approach to the selection of such an evidence threshold is based on the weights of evidence provided by values above and below the threshold. Examples used to illustrate our evidential approach to explanation include a prototype CBR system for predicting whether or not a person is over the legal blood alcohol limit for driving based on attributes such as units of alcohol consumed. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Computer aided diagnosis; Blood alcohols; Case-based reasoning approaches; CBr; CBR systems; Continuous attribute; Weights of evidences; Case based reasoning","McSherry, D.; School of Computing and Information Engineering, , Coleraine BT52 1SA, United Kingdom; email: dmg.mcsherry@ulster.ac.uk","Funk P.Gonzalez-Calero P.A.","Springer Verlag",03029743,3540228829; 9783540228820,,,"English","Lect.

The literature shows that there is a wide range of techniques available to deal with risk; however numerous studies have shown that only a relatively small number are used in practice. One reason for this small number is a lack of knowledge of the circumstances in which they can be used. With the aim of overcoming this lack of knowledge two decision support tools are developed, which assist in selecting appropriate cases. The first tool is a two-dimensional matrix which provides a graphical output but has several limitations; the second is a case-based reasoning (CBR) model. These tools have been built from literature examples of the application of risk techniques. A framework has been developed to assess the examples. It uses a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technical, Legal and Environmental) analysis to assess the problem characteristics. The associated data used in the problem were defined as fuzzy, incomplete or random. The results of the CBR validation demonstrated a tool that predicts the correct technique in excess of 80% of cases, and allows the matrix to be revised and refined.","Case-based reasoning; Decision support system; Risk management; Risk techniques","Administrative data processing; Artificial intelligence; Bits; Case based reasoning; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Environmental regulations; Industrial management; Management information systems; Risk analysis; Risk management; Built environments; Case-Based reasonings; Decision support system; Decision Support Tools; Risk Management techniques; Decision making; conceptual framework; decision support system; modeling; risk assessment; two-dimensional modeling","Forbes, D.; Division of Civil Engineering, , Dundee DD1 4HN, United Kingdom",,,01446193,,CMECF,,"English","Constr.

In a kind of ""reflective adjustment"", they fit the new problem into a patchwork of past case decisions, comparing cases in order to reason about the legal significance of the relevant similarities and differences.

In spite of the fundamentally different representation and methods for comparing cases in a CATO-style case-based reasoning system versus text-retrieval systems, the paper provides evidence that there exists a connection between the notion of similarity under both paradigms. We consider the task as a classification problem, and apply machine learning methods, where CATO's Case Database of 147 trade secret law cases are used as training instances. Since the generalization power of purely inductive algorithms, which rely on representation from conventional text-retrieval, does not measure up to the complexity of the concepts corresponding to the factors, the learning algorithms' performance is not satisfactory yet. Trying to address this problem, we discuss techniques that will allow integrating domain specific knowledge, about the use of cases in legal argumentation and about the interrelations among the factors, which is expressed in CATO's Factor Hierarchy.

In this paper we advance a novel methodology integrating case-based reasoning and computational argumentation from AI to explain outcomes, determined by humans or by machines, indifferently, for cases characterised by discrete (static) features and/or (dynamic) stages. At the heart of our methodology lies the concept of arbitrated argumentative disputesbetween two fictitious disputants arguing, respectively, for or against a case's output in need of explanation, and where this case acts as an arbiter. Specifically, in explaining the outcome of a case in question, the disputants put forward as arguments relevant cases favouring their respective positions, with arguments/cases conflicting due to their features, stages and outcomes, and the applicability of arguments/cases arbitrated by the features and stages of the case in question. We in addition use arbitrated dispute trees to identify the excess features that help the winning disputant to win the dispute and thus complement the explanation. We evaluate our novel methodology theoretically, proving desirable properties thereof, and empirically, in the context of primary legislation in the United Kingdom (UK), concerning the passage of Bills that may or may not become laws. High-level factors underpinning a Bill's passage are its content-agnostic features such as type, number of sponsors, ballot order, as well as the UK Parliament's rules of conduct. Given high numbers of proposed legislation (hundreds of Bills a year), it is hard even for legal experts to explain on a large scale why certain Bills pass or not. We show how our methodology can address this problem by automatically providing high-level explanations of why Bills pass or not, based on the given Bills and their content-agnostic features. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Argumentation; Explanation; Legislative data","Case based reasoning; Argumentation; Explanation; High-level factors; Legal experts; Legislative data; Novel methodology; United kingdom; Laws and legislation","Čyras, K.; Department of Computing, 180 Queen's Gate, United Kingdom; email: k.cyras@imperial.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062700123

Ontologies have been widely used by legal practitioners, scholars, and lay people in a variety of situations, such as simulating legal actions, semantic search and indexing, and to keep up-to-date with the continual change of laws and regulations. Given the high number of legal ontologies produced, the need to summarize this research realm through a well-defined methodological procedure is urgent need. This study presents the results of a systematic mapping of the literature, aiming at categorizing legal ontologies along certain dimensions, such as purpose, level of generality, underlying legal theories, among other aspects. The reasons to carry out a systematic mapping are twofold: in addition to explaining the maturation of the area over recent decades, it helps to avoid the old problem of reinventing the wheel. Through organizing and classifying what has already been produced, it is possible to realize that the development of legal ontologies can rise to the level of reusability where prefabricated models might be coupled with new and more complex ontologies for practical law. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Legal expert system; Legal ontology; Legal theory; Semantic web; Systematic mapping study","Case based reasoning; Expert systems; Knowledge representation; Mapping; Ontology; Reusability; Semantic Web; Conceptual model; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Laws and regulations; Legal ontology; Legal theory; Rule based reasoning; Systematic mapping; Systematic mapping studies; Laws and legislation","Rodrigues, C.M.D.O.; Federal University of Pernambuco, Center of Informatics (CIn/UFPE) P.O.

However, Chinese judgment documents are large and highly complex, so the traditional machine leaning-based classification models are often inefficient to Chinese document classification due to the fact that they fail to incorporate the overall structure and extra domain specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven knowledge block summarization approach to computing document similarity for Chinese judgment document classification. First, the extra semantic knowledge for Chinese judgment documents is adopted from the perspectives of the top-level ontology and domain-specific ontologies, where how to merge the different kinds of ontologies together in an extensible manner is further represented. Second, the core semantic knowledge residing in Chinese judgment documents can be summarized into knowledge blocks by ontology-based information extraction. Third, we use Word Mover's Distance (WMD) is to calculate the similarity between different knowledge blocks instead of their original Chinese judgment documents. At last, the KNN-based experiments for Chinese judgment document classification were made to illustrate that our approach is more effective in achieving higher classification accuracy and has faster computation speed compared to the original WMD approach. © 2018 IEEE.","Document classification; document similarity; domain ontology; WMD","Case based reasoning; Classification (of information); Data mining; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Ontology; Semantics; Classification accuracy; Computational model; Document Classification; Document similarity; Domain ontologies; Domain-specific knowledge; Domain-specific ontologies; Ontology-based information extraction; Information retrieval systems","Ma, Y.; School of Control and Computer Engineering, China; email: yinglongma@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056730809

A contributing factor to a large number of these motor vehicle accidents is speeding. Reducing drivers' tendency to speed remains a challenge. In aviation, one method that has yielded positive results in terms of improving pilots' risk management behaviour involves engaging pilots cognitively in the task (Molesworth et al.; 2006). This type of training is hypothesized to repair faulty cognitive structures known as scripts. Therefore, the main aim of the present research was to examine the utility of a training program where drivers are actively engaged following a driving episode by giving them personalised feedback in order to reduce their tendency to speed. Method: 58 young (16-24 years) motorists were divided into four groups. All participants completed both a 'training' session followed by a test session one week apart. Training consisted of either, reading three accident cases involving speeding, cases with rules associated with the offence, a simulated drive with personalised post-drive feedback regarding speeding and its legal ramifications or a card sorting task (control). The main dependent variables were percentage of distance speeding and frequency of zone violations during the simulated drive in the test session. Results: A series of planned contrast analysis with family-wise error corrected at .017 revealed that receiving personalised feedback regarding speeding behaviour following a simulated drive significantly reduced speeding tendency in the test session, when compared to control. Reading case examples alone, or coupled with rules, appeared to have no impact on speeding behaviour, compared to control. Conclusion: The results suggest that training programs that actively engage individuals about a driving episode by providing them with personalised feedback may be effective in curbing young drivers' speeding behaviour. These results are discussed from a theoretical and applied perspective. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The article presents examples of patterns of reasoning with hypotheticals in appellate legal argument and in the legal classroom and a process model of hypothetical reasoning that relates them to work in cognitive science and Artificial Intelligence. The process model describes the relationships between an advocate's proposed test for deciding a case or issue, the facts of the hypothetical and of the case to be decided, and the often conflicting legal principles and policies underlying the issue. The process model of hypothetical reasoning has been partially implemented in a computerized teaching environment, LARGO (""Legal ARgument Graph Observer"") that helps students identify, analyze, and reflect on episodes of hypothetical reasoning in oral argument transcripts. Using LARGO, students reconstruct examples of hypothetical reasoning in the oral arguments by representing them in simple diagrams that focus students on the proposed test, the hypothetical challenge to the test, and the responses to the challenge. The program analyzes the diagrams and provides feedback to help students complete the diagrams and reflect on the significance of the hypothetical reasoning in the argument. The article reports the results of experiments evaluating instruction of first year law students at the University of Pittsburgh using the LARGO program as applied to Supreme Court personal jurisdiction cases. The learning results so far have been mixed. Instruction with LARGO has been shown to help law student volunteers with lower LSAT scores learn skills and knowledge regarding hypothetical reasoning better than a text-based approach, but not when the students were required to participate. On the other hand, the diagrams students produce with LARGO have been shown to have some diagnostic value, distinguishing among law students on the basis of LSAT scores, posttest performance, and years in law school. This lends support to the underlying model of hypothetical argument and suggests using LARGO as a pedagogically diagnostic tool. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Argument diagrams; Case-based reasoning; Hypothetical reasoning; Intelligent tutoring; Modeling legal argument","Cognitive science; Diagnostic tools; Diagnostic value; First year; Hypothetical reasoning; Intelligent tutoring; Law schools; Legal principles; Process model; Student volunteers; Supreme Court; Text-based approach; University of Pittsburgh; Artificial intelligence; Graphic methods; Process monitoring; Students; Teaching; Case based reasoning","Ashley, K.

With respect to rule-based modeling, we discuss conditionality, generality and chaining. With respect to argument-based modeling, we discuss rebutting, undercutting and undermining attack. We evaluate the approach by developing a case model of the rule-based arguments and attacks in Dutch tort law.

The legal domain is an ideal domain for CBR since it relies on extensive utilization of precedents. The research presented in this paper deals with constructing the prototype of a computerized working system called The Judge's Apprentice. This system is designed for practical use in Israeli criminal cases to aid sentencing in two categories of crimes. The proposed system is intended to reinforce the principle of uniformity in sentencing i.e. passing similar sentences for similar offenses. Senior legal experts have welcomed the system. Most of them were of the opinion that the system could definitely be of advantageous use to judges and that the idea of using CBR for sentencing is relevant and should be applied. The system has been tested on 54 non-representative cases. A rather high success rate has been achieved in cases for which a precedent with high similarity has been retrieved. Future directions for research are: elaboration of the model for the handling of other types of offenses; elaboration of the model to other domains requiring case-based evaluation.",,"Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Mathematical models; Case-based reasoning (CBR) systems; Expert systems","Hacohen-Kerner, Y.; Department of Computer Science, 21 Havaad Haleumi St., 91160 Jerusalem, Israel; email: kerner@avoda.jct.ac.il",,,13610244,,NRAEA,,"English","New Rev.

Although there is a wide range of techniques available, numerous studies have shown that practitioners rely only on a few techniques. The research presented in this paper has developed a framework for breaking down risk management problems. Assessing 179 examples in the literature against this framework, a library has been created that combines techniques with given problem characteristics. Case-based reasoning (CBR) uses the principle of human reasoning as a methodology for solving problems by matching new cases to similar historic cases. This research has used the similarity measuring capability of CBR to propose risk techniques for new situations. It has been shown through CBR that risk management problems can be defined by a combination of political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors with fuzziness, incompleteness and randomness. A tool has been created that can suggest the most appropriate risk technique to be used for a given situation. Validation has shown that the recommended techniques are the most appropriate, on the basis of the case-base, more than 90% of the time. This work shows the applicability of CBR to the risk management problem and, by exploring the heuristic parameters of CBR, adds to the knowledge base in this type of modelling. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Artificial intelligence; Built environment; Case-based reasoning; Risk management; Risk techniques","Built environment; CBr; Construction projects; Environmental factors; Heuristic parameters; Human reasoning; Knowledge base; Risk management techniques; Similarity measuring; Artificial intelligence; Bits; Construction industry; Environmental regulations; Knowledge based systems; Risk management; Case based reasoning; artificial intelligence; construction; heuristics; risk assessment","Forbes, D.

CATO aids learning by making explicit an abstract model of the process of argument. It allows students to focus on the high-level argumentation issues, by assisting the student in various ways. By providing an abstract representation of the text of cases, it helps students to reason about the texts and helps guide their critical analysis of the texts.

CATO differs from other instructional environments in the following respects: Few instructional environments focus on argumentation skills.

Legal reports of previously-decided cases are used as a knowledge source for the CBR part of the system. An argumentation facility is presented, for each predicted rule-based outcome, based on Touknin's argument structures to provide support via justifications. The framework of similarity for the case base side is based on a model which exploits the fuzzy proximity relations.

However, they take into account only one side of building regulations, considering them only in the context of design systems and ignoring the existence of case histories. Building regulations are also part of a legal system and have characteristics of law. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Intensive Case-based reasoning System which can be used for the retrieval and maintenance of building regulations and case histories. First, we propose a unified knowledge representation scheme for both statutory building regulations and case histories. Second, we describe the retrieval of regulations information, which uses the notion of implied similarity as well as structural mapping. Finally, we describe knowledge acquisition from case histories, which is guided by knowledge gained from statutory regulations and case histories. © 1993 ACM.",,"Artificial intelligence; Building codes; Buildings; Case based reasoning; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Building regulations; Case based reasoning systems; Case history; Design systems; Legal system; Model based approach; Rule-based approach; Structural mapping; Laws and legislation",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,0897916069; 9780897916066,85OAA,,"English","Proc Int Conf Artif Intell Law",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48649101709

The program is described in detail in a companion article in Artificial Intelligence and Law 4: 1-71, 1996. Three perspectives are used to evaluate BankXX: (1) classical information retrieval measures of precision and recall applied against a hand-coded baseline; (2) knowledge-representation and case-based reasoning, where the baseline is provided by the functionality of a well-known case-based argument program, HYPO (Ashley, 1990); and (3) search, in which the performance of BankXX run with various parameter settings, for instance, resource limits, is compared. In this article we report on an extensive series of experiments performed to evaluate the program. We also describe two additional experiments concerning (1) the program's search behavior; and (2) the use of a modified form of precision and recall based on case similarity.

In the civil law tradition, legal reasoning on the basis of such a code would be deductive in the sense of the application of rules that are posited prior to the cases to which they should be applied. In the common law tradition, the starting point of legal reasoning is in the cases themselves. As a consequence, common law reasoning would abstract less from the peculiarities of individual cases. The main point of this paper is that Legrand's picture of civil law reasoning is based on the subsumption model of rule application, which does not allow adaptation of the law to the needs of concrete cases other than through the limited possibilities of interpretation. It is argued that this picture is wrong. As an alternative, the reason-based model of rule application is proposed, which allows legal decision makers much more leeway to tailor the law to the needs of concrete cases. In a comparison with case-based reasoning it is argued that rule-based reasoning, according to the reason-based model, gives the decision maker the same leeway. The final conclusion is that possible differences in legal culture between the civil law and the common law tradition are not rooted in the distinction between rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning, and are therefore merely contingent. There is no reason why the introduction of a European Civil Code could not overcome the differences between the two traditions.

These engines complementally draw all possible conclusions, and output them in the form of inference trees. Users can use these trees as material to construct arguments in a legal suit. HELIC-II is implemented on the parallel inference machine, and it can draw conclusions quickly by parallel inference.

It proceeds from the premise that people cope with new problems or situations by reusing the strategies that have proved effective in similar situations in the past. Rather than deduction or the application of rules, the basic inferential process is that of recognition. Because the reasoning characteristic of politics is largely of this type, we suggest that the concepts and formalisms developed within this branch of artificial intelligence can be usefully applied to the study of political institutions and political behavior. But we argue, critically, that if CBR is to be applied to politics, it must be generalized to accommodate multiple agents who act repeatedly in multiple tasks.

Precedents (statements from prior cases) play an important role in The Common Law system, where lawyers need to frequently refer to relevant prior cases. Measuring document similarity is one of the most crucial aspects of any document retrieval system which decides the speed, scalability and accuracy of the system. Text-based and network-based methods for computing similarity among case reports have already been proposed in prior works but not without a few pitfalls. Since legal citation networks are generally highly disconnected, network based metrics are not suited for them. Till date, only a few text-based and predominant embedding based methods have been employed, for instance, TF-IDF based approaches, Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013) and Doc2Vec (Le and Mikolov 2014) based approaches. We investigate the performance of 56 different methodologies for computing textual similarity across court case statements when applied on a dataset of Indian Supreme Court Cases. Among the 56 different methods, thirty are adaptations of existing methods and twenty-six are our proposed methods. The methods studied include models such as BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) and Law2Vec (Ilias 2019). It is observed that the more traditional methods (such as the TF-IDF and LDA) that rely on a bag-of-words representation performs better than the more advanced context-aware methods (like BERT and Law2Vec) for computing document-level similarity.

The act of hiding property seriously affects people’s legitimate rights and interests and China’s legal authority. Therefore, it is essential to find an effective method of analyzing whether a judgment debtor hides property. Aiming at the hidden property analysis problem, we propose a case-based reasoning method for the judgment debtor’s hidden property analysis. In the hidden property analysis process, we present the attributes of the enforcement case by crisp symbols, crisp numbers, interval numbers, and fuzzy linguistic variables and develop a hybrid similarity measure between the historical enforcement case and the target enforcement case. The results show that the recommendations obtained with the information and knowledge of similar historical cases are consistent with judicial practice, which can reduce the work pressure of law enforcement officers and improve the efficiency of handling enforcement cases. © 2021 by the authors.

The rapid uptake of wearables and connected diagnostic devices adds another source of densely collected data by the patients themselves. Integration of these data sources opens up several potentials: a longitudinal view of laboratory findings would close the gaps between individual provider visits and allow to more closely follow disease progression. Adding non-laboratory data (e.g. diagnoses, procedures) would add context and support clinical interpretation of findings. Case-based reasoning and disease-modelling approaches would allow to identify similar patient groups and classify endotypes. Realization of these potentials is, however, subject to several barriers, including legal and ethical prerequisites of data access, syntactic and semantic integration, comparability of items and user-centered presentation.

But in most instances, people have a specific purpose to their activity with data that drives the process. They often have particular questions that need answering in support of some broader investigation. These questions often change as answers point in various directions during an investigation, whether the investigation is formal (e.g., scientific, legal, journalistic, or military) or simply an informal browsing of the internet. In this paper, we take a mixed-initiative approach to knowledge discovery, and we present a system called Kyudo that supports the process using a conversational case-based reasoning process. Cases in Kyudo are sequences of knowledge goals or questions that form arcs through a multidimensional knowledge space and that form the core activity in a dialogue between the user and system. As the system gains more experience and therefore more cases, it is able to detect similarity in knowledge goals and prompt the user with additional relevant goals that can short circuit the human reasoning process to minimize tangents or false starts. In this paper we present a distance-based mechanism that reduces the total length of a goal trajectory through guidance that accelerates the human reasoning process and aids effective knowledge discovery.

Two methods: PUSH and PULL are described differing in the moment of update and the division of responsibilities between parties in the learning object exchange process. The authors recommend usage of the PUSH scenario because it is better adapted to legal requirements in many countries. It needs to be stressed that the solution is based on mutual trust of the exchange partners and therefore is most appropriate for use in educational alliances and consortia.

When such cases go to high courts, judges may handle these counterintuitive consequences by identifying problematic rule conditions. Given that the law consists of a large number of rule conditions, it is demanding and exhaustive to figure out which condition is problematic. For solving this problem, our work aims to assist judges in civil law systems to resolve counterintuitive consequences using logic program representation of statutes and Legal Debugging. The core principle of Legal Debugging is to cooperate with a user to find a culprit, a root cause of counterintuitive consequences. This article proposes an algorithm to resolve a culprit. Since the statutes are represented by logic rules but changes in law are initiated by cases, we adopt a prototypical case with judgement specified by a set of rules. Then, to resolve a culprit, we reconstruct a program so that it provides reasons as if we applied case-based reasoning to a new set of prototypical cases with judgement, which include a new set of facts relevant to a considering case. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Algorithmic debugging; Legal debugging; Legal reasoning; Legal representation","Case based reasoning; Computer circuits; Logic programming; Civil laws; High Courts; Logic programs; Logic rules; Root cause; Set of rules; Program debugging","Fungwacharakorn, W.; National Institute of Informatics, Japan; email: wachara.f@nii.ac.jp",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",09248463,,AINLE,,"English","Artif Intell Law",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103677121

Using the two classic CBR measures of lattice-based and nearest neighbor similarity, the tests use positional information about the Black Swan in the analysis of a new case, such as its being a supreme on-point case (sopc), a Level 1 (L1) case, or in the first ring of nearest neighbors (NN#1), to determine if it is a potential GC.

The analogy reasoning mode, naturally used in the legal domain, possesses a variant, called case-based reasoning (CBR). It consists in solving a new problem by reusing the solution of a similar problem already met, and stored in a memory of cases. Numerous applications based on this new paradigm have been developed in both CBR problem-solving style (dealing with cognitive tasks like diagnosis, planning,...) and interpretative style (used in interpretation, justification, or projection). Interpretative case-based reasoning is a process of assessment of situations or solutions in a previous experience context. It is naturally daily used. Indeed, judges in their courthouses interpret a new situation in the light of case already met (case of jurisprudence). In the following, we are interested in applying this style of reasoning in the Islamic legislation field as a tool for information retrieval, which can be used during the process of Fatwa generation. In Islamic legislation, the Fatwa consists in the declaration of a legal opinion in respect of the Islamic precepts. El Bayane is a CBR system conceived to help a Mufti in generating Fatwas for the new situations, by using the Fatwas of past situations. It is not able to generate a new Fatwa from scratch, but it reuses the Fatwas, by imitating an imam.","Artificial Intelligence; Case Based Reasoning; Decision support; Information Retrieval; Islamic legislation",,"Nouaouria, N.; Department of Data Processing, B.P. 12, Sidi Amar Annaba (23000), Algeria; email: nouaouria_nabila@yahoo.fr",,"Springer Verlag",2193567X,,,,"English","Arab.

Traditional Nearest-Neighbour (NN) matching has shown that it is not capable of dealing with the situations that the values of weights or dimensional matching scores are extremely high or low. These extreme situations have nonlinear psychological effects on the aggregate marching scores. Generalized Nearest-Neighbour (GNN) matching improved NN matching in certain situations, but it is not generally applicable and it can cause an unexpected ranking. In order to improve the limitation of NN matching and complement the deficiency of GNN matching, we propose a novel Nonlinear Nearest-Neighbour (NNN) matching function based on the adjustments for nonlinear effects and the fuzzy logic inference.

As one criteria for similarity of cases, temporal relations among affairs in legal cases should be compared. Thus far in many legal reasoning systems, cases have been described as sequences of pointwise events, or at best, simple time intervals, and they have been related by predicates such as before, after, while, and so on. However, such relations may depend on each implementer's personal view, and also require much labor to write down by hand. In this paper, we first propose a classification of affair types by their temporal features, and according to those types, we propose several assumption rules that prescribe the temporal relations between affair types. The temporal relations are automatically generated by these rules. Thereafter, we discuss how these temporal relations work in the comparison of similarity of cases. In the process of comparison, inadequate temporal relations need to be amended. For this purpose, we introduce revision rules, that refute the results of assumption rules.","Aspect; Case-based reasoning; Event calculus; Similarity; Temporal relations","Formal logic; Knowledge based systems; Laws and legislation; Case based reasoning; Event calculus; Legal reasoning; Temporal relations; Artificial intelligence","Tojo, S.; Japan Adv.

Because we cannot decide an appropriate case structure in advance, a framework for CBR should be able to improve a case structure dynamically, collecting and analyzing cases. Here is discussed a new framework for knowledge acquisition using CBR and model inference. Model Inference tries to obtain new descriptors(predicates) with interaction of a domain expert, regarding the predicate as the slots that compose a case structure, with an eye to the function of theoretical term generation. The framework has two features: (1) CBR obtains a more suitable group of slots (a case structure) incrementally through cooperation with model inference, and (2) model inference with theoretical term capability discovers the rules which deal with a given task better. Furthermore, we evaluate the feasibility of the framework by implementing it to deal with law interpretation and certify two features with the framework. © 1993 ACM.",,"Artificial intelligence; Knowledge acquisition; Mergers and acquisitions; Case structures; Descriptors; Domain experts; IMPROVE-A; Knowledge acquisition bottlenecks; Model inference; Theoretical terms; Case based reasoning",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,0897916069; 9780897916066,85OAA,,"English","Proc Int Conf Artif Intell Law",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021984288

The usability of such systems depends on the terms used in the law being represented: often only users familiar with the practice and application of the law will be able to provide the required information. Earlier work applied this approach to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Although the performance of the tool built for that domain was good, the questions posed to the user demanded a good deal of knowledge and experience of the ECHR. Here we use the knowledge of an expert with extensive experience of the ECHR to extend the model, through intermediate levels, to identify questions that are appropriate to the target user.

A novel system called RYEL was developed based on Subject-Matter Experts (SME) to investigate new techniques for acquiring higher-order thinking, the perception, the use of new computational explanatory techniques, support decision-making, and the judge’s cognition and behavior. Thus, a new spectrum is covered and promises to be a new area of study called Interpretation-Assessment/Assessment-Interpretation (IA-AI), consisting of explaining machine inferences and the interpretation and assessment from a human. It allows expressing a semantic, ontological, and hermeneutical meaning related to the psyche of a human (judge). The system has an interpretative and explanatory nature, and in the future, could be used in other domains of discourse. More than 33 experts in Law and Artificial Intelligence validated the functional design. More than 26 judges, most of them specializing in psychology and criminology from Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Spain, Argentina, and Costa Rica, participated in the experiments. The results of the experimentation have been very positive. As a challenge, this research represents a paradigm shift in legal data processing. © 2021 by the authors.

To do this, the choice of an ideal representation is guided by the domain characteristics and the complexity of its cases. Recently, the explosion of deep learning techniques and other forms of vectorised representations, has provided a new source for case insights. Richer text features can be extracted and used for each case if required. In this paper, we build on recent work in this area and generate richer case representation by automatically acquiring domain knowledge from unstructured sentences. We describe how the Deep Knowledge Acquisition Framework obtains its representation vectors from stemmed words and improving these vectors iteratively, suggesting high quality outputs and relevance to domain experts based on either explicit queries or their past intentions. We evaluate these ideas using two, not related, datasets from the automotive and legal domains respectively. The results show the benefits of combining Autoencoders and Siamese Networks in CBR while achieving better textual data dimensionality reduction, data de-noising and similarity measures. © 2019 IEEE.","Autoencoders; Case-based Reasoning; Deep Learning; Multi-lingual Text Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Siamese Networks; Textual CBR","Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Autoencoders; Case representation; Data de-noising; Domain knowledge; Learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Similarity measure; Text analysis; Case based reasoning",,,"IEEE Computer Society",10823409,9781728137988,PCTIF,,"English","Proc.

The statutes provided consisted of two components namely; Title and Statute description. In this study we first conduct the experiment to determine the best term weighting model for this task. After determining the best term weighting model, the second set of experiments which aimed to determine the extent to which these components (title and description of statutes) contribute to retrieval ef- fectiveness. To find out how retrieval effectiveness is affected by different components three experiments were conducted; the first involved index- ing title and description of each statute as a document, retrieval us- ing IFB2 is performed generating the first run (Baseline), the second experiment involved indexing only title disregarding description of the statutes, this generate the second run. For the final experiment, only description of statutes are indexed disregarding title, again indexing, re- trieval performed to generate the third run. The three runs were then sent to organisers for evaluation. The evaluation results shows our team came second, furthermore results suggest that indexing with title only and disregarding description of statutes is sufficient enough for retrieval of statutes. © Copyright 2019 for this paper by its authors.","Information Retrieval; Legal Statutes Retrieval; Legal Text Mining","Data mining; Indexing (of information); Comparative approach; Court decisions; Evaluation results; Legal Statutes Retrieval; Legal texts; Retrieval effectiveness; Term weighting; Two-component; Information retrieval",,"Mehta P.Rosso P.Majumder P.Mitra M.","CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076904914

As number of cases are increasing rapidly, automation becomes highly desirable. This paper presents two such systems viz. Automatic Catchphrase Detection and Automatic Precedence Detection. Automatic Catchphrase Detection: One of the key requirements of such information retrieval system is to pre-populate database of prior cases with catchphrases for better indexing and faster, relevant retrieval. This paper proposes an automatic catchphrases prediction for cases for the same. The problem catchphrase detection has been modeled as ""custom named entity recognition (NER) using conditional random fields (CRF)"". CRF is trained with pairs of prior cases and their respective catchphrases, the gold standards. The model is, then used to predict catch-phases of unseen legal texts. End of the first section demonstrates efficacy of the proposed system using practical data-set. Automatic Precedence Detection: Due to thousands of past cases it becomes tedious and error-prone to find relevant precedent, manually. An automatic precedent retrieval system is the need of the hour. One of the key requirements of such information system is to find cases which could be ""similar"" to the case in hand. The ""similarity"" used in this paper is about citations. The problem is of predicting prior cases which could potentially be cited by a particular case text. This paper proposes such association system using mixed approaches. It employs rule-based Regular Expressions based on references to statute and Articles. It finds cosine similar ity between case susing vector sgenerated by popular word embedding called doc2vec. It also leverages topic modeling by finding matches between cases based on the number of common topic words.

One of the critical application domains is the Islamic Fatawa (religious verdict) domain, which refers to seeking a legal ruling for religious issues that Muslims all over the globe pose on a daily basis. Official religious organizations like Egypt’s Dar al-Ifta1 is responsible for receiving and answering people’s religious inquiries daily. Due to the enormous number of inquiries Dar al-Ifta receives every day, it cannot be handled at the same time. This task actually requires a certain smart system that can help in fulfilling people ’s needs for answers.

Mostly a man with a need for judicial assistance approaches with an advocate to deal with his case, but this may not be useful when a person is interested in knowing and applying the exact law approach to petty issues in his life and also to avoid being a scapegoat at sometimes by few advocates who elongates the case system for his benefits. The proposed approach has an intelligent hybrid agent system composed of two subsystems, law gatherer and law decider to address the two key issues, finding out right laws and making a right choice. The law gatherer subsystem is based on the ontology web service architecture to define the ontology which is used for processing the semantic content of gathered law information. The law gatherer subsystem is composed of a knowledge system that combines Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR).

Originally conceived by cognitive scientists, since 1993 the CBR community has focused primarily on issues of interest to artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners. Some research topics of particular interest include case representation and indexing, solution retrieval and adaptation, learning (e.g., case acquisition), and integrating case-based approaches with others. Some motivating applications have included those related to customer support, recommender systems, knowledge management, diagnosis, the health sciences, and legal reasoning. Among these areas, most deployed CBR applications have been for the customer support niche of help-desk systems. These applications have the characteristic that problem descriptions are incrementally elicited from a user rather than available in complete form a priori. This category of CBR approaches is referred to as conversational (Aha et al., 2001) because they use a dialogue with the end user to identify the problem to be solved. Many case-based diagnosis and recommendation systems have used a conversational CBR (CCBR) methodology, and met with considerable success. In this presentation, I will introduce the CCBR methodology, describe its evolution, examine its various manifestations and their motivations, highlight recent work, and describe unsolved issues that could be the focus of enlightened dissertations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"Artificial intelligence researchers; Case-based reasoning (CBR); Conversational case-based reasoning; Help-desk systems; Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Health care; Information retrieval; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge representation; Problem solving; Professional aspects; Research and development management; Speech processing; Formal logic","Aha, D.W.; Intelligent Decision Aids Group, , Washington, DC 20375, United States; email: david.aha@nrl.navy.mil",,,03029743,3540305068; 9783540305064,,,"English","Lect.

This paper sets forth a model of temporal cases based on narrative grammars, demonstrates its applicability to several different domains, distinguishes two different similarity metrics - sequence overlap and tree overlap - and shows how the choice between these metrics depends on whether nonterminals in the narrative grammar correspond to abstract domain states or merely represent constraints on event transitions.

The issues of RBR and CBR in general in the context of legal knowledge-based systems and legislation in rule form and previously-decided cases in an interconnected graph form are discussed. It is possible for the user to select either reasoning method (RBR or CBR), or indicate no preference. The rule base of this system consists of two types of rule. The first type of rule determines which options are legally applicable. The second type indicates how the courts are likely to act within the range of options available, which is determined by the first type of rule. When CBR is selected, the system uses the features of previously-decided cases to select the most similar cases to the situation that is described in the input and displays their details of decisions. In case of the selection of no preference option, the system applies RBR and CBR method separately, and then presents results based on an automated relative rating of the qualities of the RBR (based on the second type of rules) and CBR advice.

Statutory legal rules used in these systems are formal and prescriptive. Building regulations in Scotland are part of statute law and constitute part of a legal system together with case histories. In recent years, the regulations have been becoming less prescriptive and more emphasis has been put onto the interpretive use of the regulations. In developing a system which can assist domain experts in interpreting the regulations, this trend has presented us with difficulties in employing this traditional approach and has led us to a unified case-based model of the regulations and case histories. In this paper, we first describe the characteristics of the regulations and the activities involved in this domain. Second, we explain the reason why we abandoned the traditional approach.

In this context, the configure-to-order (CTO) approach allows the user to define the product configuration at the time of the order and the supplier to develop a product that meets the customer's needs. This paper presents an object-oriented knowledge-based system (OOKBS) that integrates rule- and case-based reasoning to verify the compliance of a variant-rich and complex product—electric motors—in a multinational-level company. The system adopts a modular structure to evaluate distinct compliance aspects, such as technical constraints and commercial requirements, and to improve the compliance assessment based on the designs of motors previously sold. The work targeted a product line with significant market share in North America, and is the result of a collaboration among the following teams: product compliance, international sales, engineering systems, and product engineering. In total, the system development involved nine experts from these areas. This study has the originality of presenting a product configuration system (PCS) that integrates rule-based and case-based approaches to verify the compliance of a modular product. The results indicate a reduction of 73% of internal technical queries within the prototype scope. Moreover, the system usability tests highlight the completeness of outcomes, quick access to information, and easy integration of automatic product compliance verification into the company's design flow. Furthermore, we discussed how the system was effectively implemented in a design routine based on both concurrent engineering and CTO scenarios. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","compliance; electric motor; knowledge-based system; product configuration system","Case based reasoning; Commerce; Competition; Compliance control; Concurrent engineering; Electric motors; Product design; Commercial requirements; Compliance; Compliance verification; Configuration system; Customizable products; Knowledge-based systems; Multinational level; Product compliance; Product configuration; Product configuration system; Knowledge based systems","Ziegler Haselein, B.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Santa Catarina, Brazil; email: haselein.bruno@gmail.com",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc",02664720,,EXSYE,,"English","Expert Syst",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126185546

However, the formal properties of AA-CBR as a reasoning system remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we focus on analysing the non-monotonicity properties of a regular version of AA-CBR (that we call AA-CBR≽). Specifically, we prove that AA-CBR≽ is not cautiously monotonic, a property frequently considered desirable in the literature. We then define a variation of AA-CBR≽ which is cautiously monotonic. Further, we prove that such variation is equivalent to using AA-CBR≽ with a restricted casebase consisting of all “surprising” and “sufficient” cases in the original casebase. As a by-product, we prove that this variation of AA-CBR≽ is cumulative, rationally monotonic, and empowers a principled treatment of noise in “incoherent” casebases. Finally, we illustrate AA-CBR and cautious monotonicity questions on a case study on the U.S. Trade Secrets domain, a legal casebase.

Due to the extensive growth of documents of data, several statistical machine-learning methods have been developed for Legal documents data analytics. However, documents are large and highly complex, so the traditional machine learning-based classification models are inefficient for accurate data analytics with minimum time. In order to improve the accurate legal documents data analytics with minimum time, an efficient technique called Probit Regressive Tversky Indexed Rocchio Convolutive Deep Neural Learning (PRTIRCDNL) is introduced. The PRTIRCDNL technique uses the Convolutive Deep neural learning concept to learn the given input with help of many layers and provides accurate classification results. Convolutive Deep Neural Learning uses two different processing steps such as keyword extraction and classification in the different layers such as input, two hidden layers and output layer. Initially, large numbers of legal documents are collected from the dataset. Then the collected legal documents are sent to the input layer of the convolutive deep neural learning. The input legal documents are transferred into the first hidden layer where the keyword extraction process is carried out by applying the Target projective probit Regression. Then the regression function extracts the keywords based on frequent occurrence score. Then the extracted keywords are transferred into the second hidden layer where the document classification is performed using the Tversky similarity indexive Rocchio classifier. Likewise, all the legal documents are classified into different classes. The experimental evaluation is carried out using different performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and computational time with respect to the number of legal documents collected from the dataset. The observed results confirmed that the presented PRTIRCDNL technique provides the better performance in terms of achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure with minimum computation time. © 2021, Ismail Saritas.

In this paper, we use a recently developed precedent model formalism to discuss precedent comparison in case-based reasoning. With this formalism and a case study in a real legal domain, we show a new generalization and a new refinement of precedent comparison with respect to case-based reasoning approaches based on factors, such as HYPO and CATO. 1) Generalization: precedents and case facts can now be compared with general propositional formulas, and not only with factors. 2) Refinement: a distinction can be made between current analogies and distinctions in precedent models, and so-called relevances, i.e., unshared formulas between two precedents that are relevant for possible additional analogies and distinctions that can arise in a discussion. With these contributions the role of factors in case-based reasoning can be refined and compound formulas based on factors can be taken into account in case-based reasoning. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.","Case-based reasoning; Precedent comparison; Precedents","Case-based reasoning approaches; Legal case; Legal domains; Modeling formalisms; Propositional formulas; Case based reasoning","Zheng, H.; University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 9, Netherlands; email: h.zheng@rug.nl","Nalepa G.J.Nalepa G.J.Araszkiewicz M.Atzmueller M.Verheij B.Bobek S.Bobek S.","CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109214494

We develop a system called RYEL based on subject-matter experts about the legal case process, facts, pieces of evidence, and how to analyze the merits of a case. Through this system, we study the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach using Knowledge Graphs (KG) and enforcement unsupervised algorithms which results are expressed in an Explanatory Graphical Interface (EGI). The evidence and facts of a legal case are represented as knowledge graphs. Granular Computing (GrC) techniques are applied in the graph when processing nodes and edges using object types, properties, and relations. Through RYEL we propose new definitions for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (IAI) in a much better way and will help us to cover a technological spectrum that has not yet been covered and promises to be a new area of study which we call Interpretation-Assessment/Assessment-Interpretation (IA-AI) that consists not only in explaining machine inferences but the interpretation and assessment from a user according to a context. It is proposed a new focus-centered organization in which the XAI-IAI will be able to work and will allow us to explain in more detail the method implemented by RYEL. We believe our system has an explanatory and interpretive nature and could be used in other domains of discourse, some examples are: (1) the interpretation a doctor has about a disease and the assessment of using certain medicine, (2) the interpretation a psychologist has from a patient and the assessment for a psychological application treatment, (3) or how a mathematician interprets a real-world problem and makes an assessment about which mathematical formula to use.

Privacy remains one of the most elusive concepts used in legal discourse. Apparently it is not possible to define what privacy is, but it is reasonable to indicate situations which are rationally classified as privacy-relevant. In this paper we refine this view by introducing the notion of the frame - a complex knowledge representation structure that integrates the issues of relevance and the issues of classification. We discuss how this proposal may link the classical knowledge-based representation approach with the more recent, quantitative methods for legal text analysis.

UI for retrieving is not well designed for ordinary people. For example, they cannot search precedents with thing in action and what to prove to win.

It remains largely based on formal logic, including non-monotonic logic, case-based reasoning, and logic programming. However, some researchers in and practitioners of law have argued in favor of quantitative approaches (e.g. probability) to account for uncertainties in legal arguments. Other researchers have pointed some of the shortcomings of the current artificial intelligence and law research, e.g. inability to take context into account. At the same time, machine learning has made huge inroads in many different fields and applications, and therefore, the question is whether machine learning has anything to offer to the theory, and, equally important, the practice of law. As a position paper, this is a preliminary study towards the exploration of a synergistic integration of current artificial intelligence approaches in law, with machine learning approaches. It puts forward the idea that formal, logic-based approaches, currently very popular the Artificial Intelligence&Law research, could benefit from an extension with a machine learning component, and discusses some ways in which machine learning could be integrated into these approaches.",,"Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Computer circuits; Formal logic; Logic programming; Artificial intelligence and laws; Legal arguments; Logic-based approach; Machine learning approaches; Nonmonotonic logic; Position papers; Quantitative approach; Synergistic integration; Learning systems",,,"MAICS",,,,,"English","Mod.

But often, people have a specific purpose to their activity that drives the process, that is, they have particular questions that need answering in support of some broader investigation. These questions often change as answers point in various directions during an investigation, whether the investigation is formal (e.g., scientific, legal, journalistic, or military) or simply an informal browsing of the internet. Here we take a mixed-initiative approach to knowledge discovery, and we present a system called Kyudo that supports the process using a conversational case-based reasoning process. Cases in Kyudo are sequences of knowledge goals or questions that form arcs through a multidimensional knowledge space and that form the core activity in a dialogue between the user and system. As the system gains more experience and therefore more cases, it is able to detect similarity in knowledge goals and prompt the user with additional relevant goals that can short circuit the human reasoning process to minimize tangents or false starts. In this paper we present a distance-based mechanism that reduces the total length of a goal trajectory through guidance that accelerates the human reasoning process and AIDS effective knowledge discovery.

A theoretical aim of these models is to understand legal reasoning by simulating it in a computer program, while a practical aim is to study how advanced information technology can aid legal practice. First logical deduction is discussed as a necessary but insufficient component of realistic models of legal reasoning. Then models of defeasible legal reasoning and legal argumentation are discussed, which focus on the generation and comparison of reasons or arguments for and against legal claims. Computational models of legal interpretation emphasize the interplay between rules and cases and the role of principles, purposes, and values. Computational models of legal proof account for the uncertainty in legal proof in three alternative ways: with Bayesian probability theory, argumentation, and narrative. Finally, procedural models of legal reasoning are based on the idea that the quality of a legal decision partly depends on how it was reached. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

So the team-members in the design teams range from novices to experts in NPD. The juniors developer in the design project team lack more successful product-design experiences as their seniority and skills. Therefore, those developers always query and search their problems with the limited terminology via the information systems or websites. So the results of the querying and searching always are limited to the similar domain-knowledge. The new product development (NPD) involves multidisciplinary knowledge such as accumulated experiences of knowledge-workers, and different technical and legal documents. The information systems (IS) facilitating the NPD processes often include document-based knowledge management system (KMS), Product Data Management (PDM), Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems etc. With these different systems, novices at various stages of NPD processes often have problems to use the exact and suitable keywords to query the problems from those information systems. The study proposes a case-based reasoning to construct a hierarchical knowledge model to record knowledge-workers' experiences and to store the information of experiences and the recommendation of experts.

The SIROCCO (System for Intelligent Retrieval of Operationalized Cases and COdes) program employed a representation for the temporal ordering of events in ethics cases in a way that informed determinations of whether and how ethical norms were violated and if the problem and other cases were normatively analogous at a deeper level. At the same time, the program supported ordinary case enterers in translating the facts of textually described cases into a machine-processable representation. This paper presents these previously unpublished aspects of the work including a report of an empirical evaluation of the contribution of the temporal representation to the program's success in retrieving relevant norms and cases. Although the results were negative, a consideration of the reasons why is illuminating. While SIROCCO dealt with engineering ethics cases, it is clear that similar temporal considerations apply in legal cases and that the approach is likely to be useful in legal narrative representations. © 2011 ACM.","case similarity; narrative case models; representing temporal ordering","AI and law; Case similarity; Empirical evaluations; Engineering ethics; Intelligent retrieval; Legal case; Legal reasoning; narrative case models; Reasoner; Temporal ordering; Temporal representations; Artificial intelligence; Philosophical aspects; Program translators; Automata theory","McLaren, B.M.; Carnegie Mellon University, , Pittsburgh, PA, United States; email: bmclaren@cs.cmu.edu",,,,9781450307550,85OAA,,"English","Proc Int Conf Artif Intell Law",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052415574

E.g., legal drafting is closer to engineering than to legal reasoning. European Union law and implementation of EU directives provide us with court decisions based on the teleological method.

Since law is adversarial, there are usually at least two opposing viewpoints. Although either side may be quite reasonable, only one side wins in the end. An argument between two agents, such as the plaintiff and defendant, in a legal domain is very useful for classify a vague concept, because it can provide an explanation from the two sides. On the basis of the proposed structural similarity measure approach, a fuzzy legal argument is developed. This approach simulates the cognitive process of human beings in the legal argument.

In some domains of inquiry such as the legal domain, the selection of a precedent case assumes critical importance. Researchers in case-based reasoning (CBR) appear to have not paid sufficient attention to the process of precedent case selection from among a large set, perhaps due to the fact that humans are poor at it as subjectiveness comes in. This paper proposes a selection criterion based on cross-entropy, a fundamental information theoretic measure and is almost directly applicable to the problem of case selection in CBR.

It progresses by association, affinity and juxtaposition of two divergent ideas in an integrative approach. To argue a case, a legal expert cannot limit himself to the perception of isolated facts, but instead must find affinities between fields expressing more cohesion in law. In this paper, it is argued that the legal specialist relies on abstract categorization to discover a precedent and thereby create a metaphorical link that serves in the argumentation stage, and also later on in the resolution of the case. On this basis, a model of case reasoning is charted that integrates a model of analogical reasoning. In the same manner, a model of analogical reasoning is designed that combines quality induction and deduction. Furthermore, it is advocated that a rich representation of a law category is required to make a good induction. Similarly, it is specified that quality induction should be constrained by abstract rules in order to preserve legal principles and compute profound similarity between cases to discover the precedent. A better grasp of analogy can help us to improve legal information retrieval as well as legal case-based reasoning.",,,"Araj, H.; University of Montréal, Montréal, Que., Canada",,"International Society for Knowledge Organization",09437444,,,,"English","Knowl.

These macro-analyses do not distinguish programming errors from what we call ’errors of reasoning’. The latter errors may be considered to be advertent on the part of developers and/or user-professionals; may potentially be directly compared with the reasoning ascribable to a reasonably competent professional; and cannot be removed merely by better quality assurance in the sense prevalent in software engineering. In this paper we consider the mechanisms by which a court may examine errors of reasoning in expert systems used to assist professionals working in certain areas of financial services (’the financial-legal domain”). Our analysis of the ’micro’ issues of liability shows that the advertent nature of errors of reasoning makes it difficult to argue that using the best possible quality assurance methods during development is sufficient to make the reliance on an expert system reasonable. However, certain valuable defences that are available to professionals acting unaided can be made out even when expert systems are employed as part of the reasoning process, though these defences will be disabled if certain conceptual structures of the knowledge of professionals are not distinctively maintained in the knowledge base. As such, opacity of a knowledge base assists, rather than hinders, a plaintiff in establishing professional negligence. The results of an analysis of the micro-issues of liability have been applied by us in the design of a system for financial/tax planning. A case-based reasoning approach is employed, deductive rules being employed strictly in a subsidiary role. Consequently, the primary justification for a decision is a ’case’ - an instance of problem-solving by a professional - that is likely to be accepted by the court as being representative of the actions of reasonably competent professionals. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
