In this paper we put forward a formal model of reasoning with cases which captures many of the insights from that previous work. We begin by stating our view of reasoning with cases as a process of constructing, evaluating and applying a theory. Central to our model is a view of the relationship between cases, rules based on cases, and the social values which justify those rules. Having given our view of these relationships, we present our formal model of them, and explain how theories can be constructed, compared and evaluated. We then show how previous work can be described in terms of our model, and discuss extensions to the basic model to accommodate particular features of previous work. We conclude by identifying some directions for future work. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, these models have not accounted for the ways that attorneys use middle-level normative background knowledge (1) to organize multi-case arguments, (2) to reason about the significance of differences between cases, and (3) to assess the relevance of precedent cases to a given problem situation. We present a novel model, that accounts for these argumentation phenomena. An evaluation study showed that arguments about the significance of distinctions based on this model help predict the outcome of cases in the area of trade secrets law, confirming the quality of these arguments. The model forms the basis of an intelligent learning environment called CATO, which was designed to help beginning law students acquire basic argumentation skills. CATO uses the model for a number of purposes, including the dynamic generation of argumentation examples. In a second evaluation study, carried out in the context of an actual legal writing course, we compared instruction with CATO against the best traditional legal writing instruction. The results indicate that CATO's example-based instructional approach is effective in teaching basic argumentation skills. However, a more ""integrated"" approach appears to be needed if students are to achieve better transfer of these skills to more complex contexts. CATO's argumentation model and instructional environment are a contribution to the research fields of AI and Law, Case-Based Reasoning, and AI and Education. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The program addresses a technologically challenging task that is also very relevant from a legal viewpoint: to extract information from textual descriptions of the facts of decided cases and apply that information to predict the outcomes of new cases. The program attempts to automatically classify textual descriptions of the facts of legal problems in terms of Factors, a set of classification concepts that capture stereotypical fact patterns that effect the strength of a legal claim, here trade secret misappropriation. Using these classifications, the program can evaluate and explain predictions about a problem's outcome given a database of previously classified cases. This paper provides an extended example illustrating both functions, prediction by IBP and text classification by SMILE, and reports empirical evaluations of each. While IBP's results are quite strong, and SMILE's much weaker, SMILE + IBP still has some success predicting and explaining the outcomes of case scenarios input as texts. It marks the first time to our knowledge that a program can reason automatically about legal case texts. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Case-based reasoning; Classifying case texts; Predicting case outcomes","Classifying case texts; Computer program; Empirical evaluations; Extracting information; Legal case; Legal problems; Predicting case outcomes; Predicting outcomes; Text classification; Textual description; Trade secrets; Text processing; Case based reasoning","Aleven, V., (1997) Teaching Case-Based Argumentation Through A Model And Examples, , Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pittsburgh; Aleven, V., Using background knowledge in case-based legal reasoning: a computational model and an intelligent learning environment (2003) Artif Intell, 150, pp. 183-237; Ashley, K., (1988) Modeling Legal Argument: Reasoning With Cases And Hypotheticals, , Ph.D. dissertation.

Unlike the predictions generated by statistical or machine-learning techniques, IBP's predictions are accompanied by explanations.We describe an empirical evaluation of IBP, in which we compare our algorithm to prediction based on Hypo's and CATO's relevance criteria, and to a number of widely used machine learning algorithms. IBP reaches higher accuracy than all competitors, and hypothesis testing shows that the observed differences are statistically significant. An ablation study indicates that both sources of knowledge in IBP contribute to the accuracy of its predictions.",,"Abstract domains; Case based; Empirical evaluations; Hypothesis testing; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning techniques; Predicting outcomes; Relevance criteria; Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Forecasting; Learning algorithms","Aha, D., Case-based learning algorithms (1991) Proceedings of the DARPA Case-Based Reasoning Workshop, pp. 147-158; Aleven, V., (1997) Teaching Case-Based Argumentation Through a Model and Examples, , Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Pittsburgh; Aleven, V., Using Background Knowledge in Case-Based Legal Reasoning: A Computational Model and an Intelligent Learning Environment.

It is difficult, however, if not impossible to define principles in an intensional manner so that they may be applied deductively. The problem is the gap between the abstract, open-textured principles and concrete facts. On the other hand, when expert decision-makers rationalize their conclusions in specific cases, they often link principles to the specific facts of the cases. In effect, these expert-defined associations between principles and facts provide extensional definitions of the principles. The experts operationalize the abstract principles by linking them to the facts. This paper discusses research in which the following hypothesis was empirically tested: extensionally defined principles, as well as cited past cases, can help in predicting the principles and cases that might be relevant in the analysis of new cases. To investigate this phenomenon computationally, a large set of professional ethics cases was analyzed and a computational model called SIROCCO, a system for retrieving principles and past cases, was constructed. Empirical evidence is presented that the operationalization information contained in extensionally defined principles can be leveraged to predict the principles and past cases that are relevant to new problem situations. This is shown through an ablation experiment, comparing SIROCCO to a version of itself that does not employ operationalization information. Further, it is shown that SIROCCO's extensionally defined principles and case citations help it to outperform a full-text retrieval program that does not employ such information. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Construction accidents tend to cause serious damages, injuries, fatalities, and work interruptions, and provoke disputes among the involved parties. One useful means for resolving the dispute through alternative dispute resolution, instead of costly litigation, is to find similar accidents occurring in the past in the same jurisdiction and compare their similarities and differences. This paper introduces a research project on the effective retrieval of relevant historical cases from a case library using text mining techniques. Research issues in the text mining process, especially how to represent the unstructured textual cases by a structured term vector model, are investigated. It is concluded that natural language based case document retrieval is superior to the case-based reasoning from structured case collection and is more practical for implementation in a construction management information system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The formal framework of Prakken and Sartor (1998) is applied to examples of case-based reasoning involving values, and a method for formalising such examples is proposed. The method makes it possible to express that a case should be decided in a certain way because that advances certain values. The method also supports the comparison of conflicting precedents in terms of values, and it supports debates on the relevance of distinctions in terms of values.",,"Computational complexity; Decision theory; Knowledge based systems; Logic programming; Mathematical models; Semantics; Legal reasoning; Teleological case-based reasoning; Formal logic","Aleven, V., (1997) Teaching Case-Based Argumentation Through a Model and Examples, , PhD Dissertation.

As part of the reconstruction, a semi-formal proposal is made for extending the formal AI & Law models with forms of metalevel reasoning in several argument schemes.

In particular, we provide a reconstruction of the reasoning of the majority and dissenting opinions for a particular well-known case from property law. This is done through the use of Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to replicate the contrasting views involved in the actual decision. This reconstruction suggests that the reasoning involved can be separated into three distinct levels: factual and normative levels and a level connecting the two, with conclusions at one level forming premises at the next. We begin by summarising our general approach, which uses instantiations of an argumentation scheme to provide presumptive justifications for actions, and critical questions to identify arguments which attack these justifications. These arguments and attacks are organised into argumentation frameworks to identify the status of individual arguments. We then discuss the levels of reasoning that occur in this reconstruction and the properties and significance of each of these levels. We illustrate the different levels with short examples and also include a discussion of the role of precedents within these levels of reasoning. © Springer 2006.","Argumentation; Case based reasoning; Intermediate legal concepts; Legal decision making; Practical reasoning; Teleological reasoning","Decision making; Information analysis; Laws and legislation; Argumentation; Case based reasoning; Intermediate legal concepts; Legal decision making; Practical reasoning; Teleological reasoning; Information science","Aleven, V., (1997) Teaching Case Based Argumentation Through an Example and Models, , PhD thesis, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Ashley, K.D., (1990) Modeling Legal Argument, , MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, USA; Ashley, K.D., Brüninghaus, S., A predictive role for intermediate legal concepts (2003) Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (Jurix 2003), pp. 153-162. , Bourcier, D.

Ontologies for different systems allows comparison and contrast between them. OWL ontologies are standardised, machine-readable formats that support automated processing with Semantic Web applications. Intermediate concepts, concepts between base-level concepts and higher level concepts, are central in LCBR. The main issues and their relevance to ontological reasoning and to LCBR are discussed. Two LCBR systems (AS-CATO, which is based on CATO, and IBP) are analysed in terms of basic and intermediate concepts. Central components of the OWL ontologies for these systems are presented, pointing out differences and similarities. The main novelty of the paper is the ontological analysis and representation in OWL of LCBR systems. The paper also emphasises the important issues concerning the representation and reasoning of intermediate concepts. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Case-based reasoning; Legal cases; Legal reasoning; Ontology; OWL","Case based reasoning; Information theory; Paper; Semantic Web; Central components; General specifications; Intermediate concepts; Legal cases; Legal reasoning; Ontological analyses; Ontological reasonings; OWL; OWL ontologies; Semantic web applications; Support automated; Web Ontology languages; Ontology","Aleven, V., (1997) Teaching Case-based Argumentation Through A Model and Examples, , PhD thesis, University of Pittsburgh; Aleven, V., Ashley, K.D., What law students need to know to win (1993) ICAIL '93: Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 152-161. , ACM, New York, NY, USA doi: 10.1145/158976.158995; Aleven, V., Ashley, K.D., Doing things with factors (1995) ICAIL '95: Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 31-41. , ACM, New York, NY, USA doi: 10.1145/222092.222106; Antoniou, G., Van Harmelen, F., (2004) A Semantic Web Primer, , The MIT Press; Reasoning web (2007) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4636. , Antoniou G, Assmann U, Baroglio C, Decker S, Henze N, Patranjan PL, Tolksdorf R (eds) Third international summer school 2007, Dresden, Germany, September 3-7, 2007, Tutorial lectures Springer; Ashley, K., (1990) Modeling Legal Argument: Reasoning with Cases and Hypotheticals, , Bradford Books/MIT Press Cambridge, MA; Ashley, K.D., Brüninghaus, S., A predictive role for intermediate legal concepts (2003) Legal Knowledge and Information Systems, Proceedings of Jurix 2003, pp. 153-162. , http://www.jurix.nl/pdf/j03-21.pdf, Bourcier D (ed) IOS Press, Amsterdam; Atkinson, K., Bench-Capon, T., Legal case-based reasoning as practical reasoning (2006) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 13, pp. 93-131. , doi: 10.1007/s10506-006-9003-3; Bench-Capon, T.J., Knowledge based systems applied to law: A framework for discussion (1991) Knowledge Based Systems and Legal Applications, pp. 329-342. , Bench-Capon TJ (ed) Academic Press; Bench-Capon, T., Arguing with cases (1997) JURIX 1997, pp. 85-100. , Oskamp A, et al (eds) Gerard Noodt Instituut, Nijmegen; Bench-Capon, T., Sartor, G., A model of legal reasoning with cases incorporating theories and values (2003) Artificial Intelligence, 150 (1-2), pp. 97-143. , doi: 10.1016/S0004-3702(03)00108-5; Bench-Capon, T.J., Visser, P.R., Deep models, ontologies and legal knowledge based systems (1996) Legal Knowledge Based Systems.

Among the problems that still need to be solved before they can fully autonomously participate in traffic is the one of making their behaviour conform to the traffic laws. This paper discusses this problem by way of a case study of Dutch traffic law. First it is discussed to what extent Dutch traffic law exhibits features that are traditionally said to pose challenges for AI & Law models, such as exceptions, rule conflicts, open texture and vagueness, rule change, and the need for commonsense knowledge. Then three approaches to the design of law-conforming AV are evaluated in light of the challenges posed by Dutch traffic law, which includes an assessment of the usefulness of AI & Law models of nonmonotonic reasoning, argumentation and case-based reasoning. © 2017, The Author(s).","Autonomous vehicles; Legal reasoning; Traffic law","Vehicles; Autonomous Vehicles; Commonsense knowledge; Legal reasoning; Non-monotonic reasoning; Rule changes; Rule conflict; Traffic laws; Case based reasoning","Aleven, V., Using background knowledge in case-based legal reasoning: a computational model and an intelligent learning environment (2003) Artif Intell, 150, pp. 183-237; Aleven, V., Ashley K (1995) Doing things with factors Proceedings of the fifth international conference on artificial intelligence and law, pp. 31-41. , ACM Press, New York; Anderson, M., Anderson, S., (2011) Machine ethics, , eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Anderson, J.M., Kalra, N., Stanley, K., Sorensen, O., Samaras, C., Oluwatola, O., (2016) Autonomous vehicle technology.

To alleviate this problem, we propose algorithms for automatically generating and refining case instances from real-world judgment documents for criminal summary judgments. Our algorithms attempt to extract important legal information from the documents of past lawsuits to build case instances, and then refine these case instances by merging similar cases and removing relatively irrelevant information from the cases. Experimental results, obtained from applying the resulting cases to classifying real-world lawsuits, indicate that our algorithms are viable for assisting the task of building case databases for case-based legal reasoning systems.","Artificial intelligence; Case-based reasoning; Chinese legal information system; Rule-based reasoning; Text mining; Weighted k-nearest neighbor","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Database systems; Indexing (of information); Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Legacy systems; Case-based reasoning; Chinese legal information system; Rule-based reasoning; Weighted k-nearest neighbor; Information science","http://wjirs.judicial.gov.tw/jirs/; http://www.ly.gov.tw/; http://www.moj.gov.tw/; http://www.lawbank.com.tw/; http://www.ordos.nm.cn/haoxia/navigation/zhengfa.htm; Aleven, V., Teaching Case-based Argumentation Through a Model and Examples, , Ph.D. Dissertation, Intelligent Systems Program, University of Pittsburgh, U.S.A; Branting, L.K., Lester, J., Callaway, C., Automating judicial document drafting: A discourse-based approach (1998) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 6, pp. 111-149; Brown, G., CHINATAX: Exploring isomorphism with Chinese law (1993) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 175-179; Brüninghaus, S., Ashley, K.D., Toward adding knowledge to learning algorithms for indexing legal cases (1999) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 9-17; Brüninghaus, S., Ashley, K.D., Improving the representation of legal case texts with information extraction methods (2001) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 42-51; Cammelli, A., Socci, F., A thesaurus for improving information retrieval in an integrated legal expert system (1998) Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 619-624; Chang, C.T., Ho, J.H., Liu, C.L., Decision support for criminal summary judgment (2002) Proceedings of the TAAI 7th Conference on AI and Applications, pp. 178-183; Chen, C.S., Legal informatics in Germany (2001) China Law Journal, 46, pp. 79-85; Cost, S., Salzberg, S., A weighted nearest neighbor algorithm for learning with symbolic features (1993) Machine Learning, 10, pp. 57-78; Hafner, C., Berman, D., The role of context in case-based legal reasoning: Teleological, temporal and procedural (2002) Artificial and Law, 10, pp. 19-64; Hirschberg, D.S., Algorithms for the longest common subsequence problem (1997) Journal of the ACM, 24, pp. 664-675; http://www.keenage.com; Lai, T.B.Y., Huang, C., Dependency-based syntactic analysis of Chinese and annotation of parsed corpus (2000) Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 255-262; Leake, D.B., (1996) Case-based Reasoning, , MIT Press; Legrand, J., A contribution to indexing in legal information retrieval (1997) Proceedings of the 8th Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 213-218; Liu, C.L., Chang, C.T., Some case-refinement strategies for case-based criminal summary judgments (2003) Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, 2871, pp. 285-291; Liu, C.L., Chang, C.T., Ho, J.H., Classification and clustering for case-based criminal summary judgments (2003) Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 252-261; Manning, C.D., Schütze, H., (1999) Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, , MIT Press; Merkl, D., Schweighofer, E., Winiwarter, W., Exploratory analysis of concept and document spaces with connectionist networks (1999) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 7, pp. 185-209; Moens, M.F., Uyttendaele, C., Dumortier, J., Abstracting of legal cases: The SALOMON experience (1997) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 114-122; Pannu, A.S., Using genetic algorithms to inductively reason with cases in the legal domain (1995) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 175-184; Schild, U.J., Intelligent computer systems for criminal sentencing (1995) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 229-238; Thompson, P., Automatic categorization of case law (2001) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 70-77; Weber, R., Intelligent jurisprudence research: A new concept (1999) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 164-172; Wu, C.W., Liu, C.L., Ontology-based text summarization for business news articles (2003) Proceedings of the ISCA 18th International Conference on Computers and Their Applications, pp. 389-392","Liu, C.-L.; Department of Computer Science, , Taipei, 116, Taiwan; email: chaolin@nccu.edu.tw",,,10162364,,JINEE,,"English","J.

By failing to distinguish between features that support and oppose the predicted outcome, we argue, such explanations are not only less informative than might be expected, but also potentially misleading. To address this issue, we present an evidential approach to explanation in which a key role is played by techniques for the discovery of features that support or oppose the predicted outcome. Often in assessing the evidence provided by a continuous attribute, the problem is where to ""draw the line* between values that support and oppose the predicted outcome. Our approach to the selection of such an evidence threshold is based on the weights of evidence provided by values above and below the threshold. Examples used to illustrate our evidential approach to explanation include a prototype CBR system for predicting whether or not a person is over the legal blood alcohol limit for driving based on attributes such as units of alcohol consumed. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Computer aided diagnosis; Blood alcohols; Case-based reasoning approaches; CBr; CBR systems; Continuous attribute; Weights of evidences; Case based reasoning","Brüninghaus, S., Ashley, K.D., Combining Case-Based and Model-Based Reasoning for Predicting the Outcome of Legal Cases (2003) LNAI, 2689, pp. 65-79. , Ashley, K.D., Bridge, D.G.

The literature shows that there is a wide range of techniques available to deal with risk; however numerous studies have shown that only a relatively small number are used in practice. One reason for this small number is a lack of knowledge of the circumstances in which they can be used. With the aim of overcoming this lack of knowledge two decision support tools are developed, which assist in selecting appropriate cases. The first tool is a two-dimensional matrix which provides a graphical output but has several limitations; the second is a case-based reasoning (CBR) model. These tools have been built from literature examples of the application of risk techniques. A framework has been developed to assess the examples.

The KE approach is grounded in artificial intelligence (AI) and case-based reasoning (CBR), whilst the NLP approach is associated with open domain statistical retrieval. We provide some original arguments regarding the focus on KE-based retrieval in the past and why this is not sustainable in the long term. Legal approaches to questioning (NLP), rather than arguing (CBR), are proposed as the appropriate jurisprudential and cognitive underpinning for legal IR. Recall within the context of precision is proposed as a better fit to law than the 'total recall' model of the past, wherein conceptual and contextual search are combined to improve retrieval performance for both parties in a dispute. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

The HYPO family of systems implements a ""lazy"" approach since they defer making arguments how to decide a problem until the programs have positioned a new problem with respect to similar past cases. In a kind of ""reflective adjustment"", they fit the new problem into a patchwork of past case decisions, comparing cases in order to reason about the legal significance of the relevant similarities and differences. Empirical evidence from diverse experiments shows that for purposes of teaching legal argumentation and performing legal information retrieval, HYPO-style systems' lazy learning approach and implementation of aspects of reflective adjustment can be very effective. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

IBP uses a weak model of the domain to identify the issues raised in a case, and to combine the analyses for these issues; it reasons with cases to resolve conflicting evidence related to each issue. IBP reasons symbolically about the relevance of cases and uses evidential inferences. Experiments with a collection of historic cases show that IBP’s predictions are better than those made with its weak model or with cases alone. IBP also has higher accuracy compared to standard inductive and instance-based learning algorithms. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,"Algorithms; Algorithms; Mathematical models; Case based; Cbr applications; Conflicting evidence; Instance based learning; Legal case; Model-based Reasoning; Weak models; Case based reasoning; Computer aided software engineering; Case-based reasoning (CBR); Legal cases; Model-based reasoning","Aha, D., Case-based learning algorithms (1991) In Proce.

In this paper we advance a novel methodology integrating case-based reasoning and computational argumentation from AI to explain outcomes, determined by humans or by machines, indifferently, for cases characterised by discrete (static) features and/or (dynamic) stages. At the heart of our methodology lies the concept of arbitrated argumentative disputesbetween two fictitious disputants arguing, respectively, for or against a case's output in need of explanation, and where this case acts as an arbiter. Specifically, in explaining the outcome of a case in question, the disputants put forward as arguments relevant cases favouring their respective positions, with arguments/cases conflicting due to their features, stages and outcomes, and the applicability of arguments/cases arbitrated by the features and stages of the case in question. We in addition use arbitrated dispute trees to identify the excess features that help the winning disputant to win the dispute and thus complement the explanation. We evaluate our novel methodology theoretically, proving desirable properties thereof, and empirically, in the context of primary legislation in the United Kingdom (UK), concerning the passage of Bills that may or may not become laws. High-level factors underpinning a Bill's passage are its content-agnostic features such as type, number of sponsors, ballot order, as well as the UK Parliament's rules of conduct. Given high numbers of proposed legislation (hundreds of Bills a year), it is hard even for legal experts to explain on a large scale why certain Bills pass or not. We show how our methodology can address this problem by automatically providing high-level explanations of why Bills pass or not, based on the given Bills and their content-agnostic features. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Argumentation; Explanation; Legislative data","Case based reasoning; Argumentation; Explanation; High-level factors; Legal experts; Legislative data; Novel methodology; United kingdom; Laws and legislation","Al-Abdulkarim, L., Atkinson, K., Bench-Capon, T.J.M., A methodology for designing systems to reason with legal cases using abstract dialectical frameworks (2016) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 24 (1), pp. 1-49; Amgoud, L., Prade, H., Using arguments for making and explaining decisions (2009) Artificial Intelligence, (3-4), pp. 413-436; Amgoud, L., Serrurier, M., Agents that argue and explain classifications (2008) Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, 16 (2), pp. 187-209; Baroni, P., Giacomin, M., Semantics of abstract argument systems (2009) Argumentation in artificial intelligence, pp. 25-44. , G.R.

Ontology, an emerging research topic in recent years, incorporates a hierarchical structure and supports logical reasoning, which can reduce semantic ambiguities and extract implied semantic information. We constructed statutes ontology and a case ontology using a bottom-up method and a top-down method, respectively. Then, to test the retrieval precision of the proposed CLCS, we performed experiments using emotional damage compensation as an example by combining genetic algorithm and k-nearest neighbor approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves retrieval precision. © 2013 IEEE.","Case similarity; google distance; legal ontology; legal retrieval; semantic recognition","Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Semantics; Case similarity; Google distances; Legal ontology; Legal Retrieval; Semantic recognition; Ontology","Noy, N.F., Hafner, C.D., The state of the art in ontology design: A survey and comparative review (1997) AI Mag., 18 (3), pp. 53-74; Valente, A., Types and roles of legal ontologies (2005) Law and the Semantic Web: Legal Ontologies, Methodologies, Legal Information Retrieval, and Applications (Lecture Notes in Computer Science), pp. 65-76. , V.

The approaches are implemented in two versions of CATO, an ITS designed to teach law students basic skills of case-based legal argument. The original version of CATO employed a didactic explanatory dialogue. The newer version, CATO-Dial, teaches the same skill with a simulated dialectic argument in a courtroom setting. Our hypothesis was that students would learn better by engaging in the simulated argument than by receiving interactive explanation. We showed that students in the dialectic argument simulation group performed significantly better on certain sections of the post-test aimed at assessing transfer of their skills of distinguishing. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",,"Computer aided instruction; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Students; Automated approach; Case based; Context sensitive; Legal arguments; Post test; Case based reasoning","Aleven, V., (1997) Teaching Case-Based Argumentation through a Model and Examples, , Ph.D. Dis., U.

Recently, the topic of explanation of decisions has taken on a new urgency, throughout AI in general, with the increasing deployment of AI tools and the need for lay users to be able to place trust in the decisions that the support tools are recommending. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the variety of techniques for explanation that have been developed in AI and Law. We summarise the early contributions and how these have since developed. We describe a number of notable current methods for automated explanation of legal reasoning and we also highlight gaps that must be addressed by future systems to ensure that accurate, trustworthy, unbiased decision support can be provided to legal professionals. We believe that insights from AI and Law, where explanation has long been a concern, may provide useful pointers for future development of explainable AI. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AI and law; Case-based reasoning; Computational models of argument; Explainable AI","Artificial intelligence; AI and law; AI systems; Decision supports; Legal reasoning; Support tool; Decision support systems","Al-Abdulkarim, L., Atkinson, K., Bench-Capon, T., Accommodating change (2016) Artif.

Ontologies have been widely used by legal practitioners, scholars, and lay people in a variety of situations, such as simulating legal actions, semantic search and indexing, and to keep up-to-date with the continual change of laws and regulations. Given the high number of legal ontologies produced, the need to summarize this research realm through a well-defined methodological procedure is urgent need. This study presents the results of a systematic mapping of the literature, aiming at categorizing legal ontologies along certain dimensions, such as purpose, level of generality, underlying legal theories, among other aspects. The reasons to carry out a systematic mapping are twofold: in addition to explaining the maturation of the area over recent decades, it helps to avoid the old problem of reinventing the wheel. Through organizing and classifying what has already been produced, it is possible to realize that the development of legal ontologies can rise to the level of reusability where prefabricated models might be coupled with new and more complex ontologies for practical law. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Legal expert system; Legal ontology; Legal theory; Semantic web; Systematic mapping study","Case based reasoning; Expert systems; Knowledge representation; Mapping; Ontology; Reusability; Semantic Web; Conceptual model; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Laws and regulations; Legal ontology; Legal theory; Rule based reasoning; Systematic mapping; Systematic mapping studies; Laws and legislation","Abrahams, B., Condliffe, P., Zeleznikow, J., Using an owl ontology to support legal negotiation about owners corporation disputes (2011) Proceedings of the 13th international conference on artificial intelligence and law, pp. 194-198. , ACM New York, NY, USA ICAIL ’11; Adams, W.A., A transdisciplinary ontology of innovation governance (2008) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 16 (2), pp. 147-174; Agnoloni, T., Francesconi, E., Modelling semantic profiles in legislative documents for enhanced norm accessibility (2011) ICAIL, pp. 111-115. , ACM; Agnoloni, T., Tiscornia, D., Semantic web standards and ontologies for legislative drafting support (2010) Electronic participation, pp. 184-196. , E.

However, Chinese judgment documents are large and highly complex, so the traditional machine leaning-based classification models are often inefficient to Chinese document classification due to the fact that they fail to incorporate the overall structure and extra domain specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven knowledge block summarization approach to computing document similarity for Chinese judgment document classification. First, the extra semantic knowledge for Chinese judgment documents is adopted from the perspectives of the top-level ontology and domain-specific ontologies, where how to merge the different kinds of ontologies together in an extensible manner is further represented. Second, the core semantic knowledge residing in Chinese judgment documents can be summarized into knowledge blocks by ontology-based information extraction. Third, we use Word Mover's Distance (WMD) is to calculate the similarity between different knowledge blocks instead of their original Chinese judgment documents. At last, the KNN-based experiments for Chinese judgment document classification were made to illustrate that our approach is more effective in achieving higher classification accuracy and has faster computation speed compared to the original WMD approach. © 2018 IEEE.","Document classification; document similarity; domain ontology; WMD","Case based reasoning; Classification (of information); Data mining; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Ontology; Semantics; Classification accuracy; Computational model; Document Classification; Document similarity; Domain ontologies; Domain-specific knowledge; Domain-specific ontologies; Ontology-based information extraction; Information retrieval systems","De Mantaras, R.L., Retrieval, reuse, revision and retention in casebased reasoning (2005) Knowl.

One scheme is based on similarity, while the other scheme is based on factors shared or not shared by two cases that are being compared. The problem confronted in the paper is to study how the two schemes fit together. Are there really two different schemes for argument from analogy, or is the one scheme an extension of the other that applies at a different dialectical stage of the argumentation in a case? Since argument from analogy is fundamental in case-based reasoning and legal reasoning, there is some discussion of how the schemes fit into both topics. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Artificial intelligence; Case-based reasoning; Legal rhetoric; Scripts; Story schemes",,"Aleven, V., (1997) Teaching Case Based Argumentation through an Example and Models, , PhD diss., University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Ashley, K., (1988) Arguing by Analogy in Law: A Case-Based Model, pp. 205-224. , Analogical reasoning, ed.

VJAP creates an argument graph for each case using argument schemes and a representation of values underlying trade secret law and eects of facts on these values. It balances eects on values in each case and analogizes it to tradeos in precedents. It predicts case outcomes using a condence measure computed from the graph and generates textual legal arguments justifying its predictions. The condence propagation uses quantitative weights learned from past cases using an iterative optimization method. Prediction performance on a limited dataset is competitive with common machine learning models.

A contributing factor to a large number of these motor vehicle accidents is speeding. Reducing drivers' tendency to speed remains a challenge. In aviation, one method that has yielded positive results in terms of improving pilots' risk management behaviour involves engaging pilots cognitively in the task (Molesworth et al.; 2006). This type of training is hypothesized to repair faulty cognitive structures known as scripts. Therefore, the main aim of the present research was to examine the utility of a training program where drivers are actively engaged following a driving episode by giving them personalised feedback in order to reduce their tendency to speed. Method: 58 young (16-24 years) motorists were divided into four groups. All participants completed both a 'training' session followed by a test session one week apart. Training consisted of either, reading three accident cases involving speeding, cases with rules associated with the offence, a simulated drive with personalised post-drive feedback regarding speeding and its legal ramifications or a card sorting task (control). The main dependent variables were percentage of distance speeding and frequency of zone violations during the simulated drive in the test session. Results: A series of planned contrast analysis with family-wise error corrected at .017 revealed that receiving personalised feedback regarding speeding behaviour following a simulated drive significantly reduced speeding tendency in the test session, when compared to control. Reading case examples alone, or coupled with rules, appeared to have no impact on speeding behaviour, compared to control. Conclusion: The results suggest that training programs that actively engage individuals about a driving episode by providing them with personalised feedback may be effective in curbing young drivers' speeding behaviour. These results are discussed from a theoretical and applied perspective. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The article presents examples of patterns of reasoning with hypotheticals in appellate legal argument and in the legal classroom and a process model of hypothetical reasoning that relates them to work in cognitive science and Artificial Intelligence. The process model describes the relationships between an advocate's proposed test for deciding a case or issue, the facts of the hypothetical and of the case to be decided, and the often conflicting legal principles and policies underlying the issue. The process model of hypothetical reasoning has been partially implemented in a computerized teaching environment, LARGO (""Legal ARgument Graph Observer"") that helps students identify, analyze, and reflect on episodes of hypothetical reasoning in oral argument transcripts. Using LARGO, students reconstruct examples of hypothetical reasoning in the oral arguments by representing them in simple diagrams that focus students on the proposed test, the hypothetical challenge to the test, and the responses to the challenge. The program analyzes the diagrams and provides feedback to help students complete the diagrams and reflect on the significance of the hypothetical reasoning in the argument. The article reports the results of experiments evaluating instruction of first year law students at the University of Pittsburgh using the LARGO program as applied to Supreme Court personal jurisdiction cases. The learning results so far have been mixed. Instruction with LARGO has been shown to help law student volunteers with lower LSAT scores learn skills and knowledge regarding hypothetical reasoning better than a text-based approach, but not when the students were required to participate. On the other hand, the diagrams students produce with LARGO have been shown to have some diagnostic value, distinguishing among law students on the basis of LSAT scores, posttest performance, and years in law school. This lends support to the underlying model of hypothetical argument and suggests using LARGO as a pedagogically diagnostic tool. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Argument diagrams; Case-based reasoning; Hypothetical reasoning; Intelligent tutoring; Modeling legal argument","Cognitive science; Diagnostic tools; Diagnostic value; First year; Hypothetical reasoning; Intelligent tutoring; Law schools; Legal principles; Process model; Student volunteers; Supreme Court; Text-based approach; University of Pittsburgh; Artificial intelligence; Graphic methods; Process monitoring; Students; Teaching; Case based reasoning","Aleven, V., Using background knowledge in case-based legal reasoning: A computational model and an intelligent learning environment (2003) Artif Intell, 150, pp. 183-238. , 1082.68595 10.1016/S0004-3702(03)00105-X; Ashley, K., Modelling legal argument: Reasoning with cases and hypotheticals (1988) COINS Tech Rept 88-01, , Ph.D. dissertation, University of Massachusetts at Amherst; Ashley, K., (1990) Modeling Legal Argument: Reasoning with Cases and Hypotheticals, , The MIT Press Cambridge; Ashley, K., Designing electronic casebooks that talk back: The CATO program (2000) Jurimetrics, 40, pp. 275-319; Atkinson, K., Bench-Capon, T., Argumentation and standards of proof (2007) Proceedings of 11th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 107-116. , ACM Press; Bench-Capon, T., Sartor, G., A model of legal reasoning with cases incorporating theories and values (2003) Artif Intell, 150 (12), pp. 97-143. , 1082.68796 10.1016/S0004-3702(03)00108-5; Berman, D., Hafner, C., Representing teleological structure in case-based legal reasoning: The missing link (1993) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference of Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 50-59. , ACM Press; Brewer, S., Exemplary reasoning: Semantics, pragmatics, and the rational force of legal argument by analogy (1996) Harv Law Rev, 109, pp. 923-1028. , 10.2307/1342258; Carr, C., Using computer supported argument visualization to teach legal argumentation (2003) Visualizing Argumentation, pp. 75-96. , Springer, London; Eisenberg, M., (1988) The Nature of the Common Law Cambridge, , Harvard University Press MA; Fuller, L., Positivism and fidelity to law-a reply to Professor Hart (1958) Harv Law Rev, 71, pp. 662-664; Gewirtz, P., The jurisprudence of hypotheticals (1982) J Legal Educ, 32, p. 120; Gordon, T.F., Prakken, H., Walton, D., The Carneades model of argument and burden of proof (2007) Artificial Intelligence, 171 (10-15), pp. 875-896. , DOI 10.1016/j.artint.2007.04.010, PII S0004370207000677; Harrell, M., Using argument diagramming software to teach critical thinking skills (2007) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Education and Information Systems, Technologies and Applications; Harris, C., Pritchard, M., Rabins, M., (2004) Engineering Ethics Concepts and Cases, , 3 Wadsworth Belmont; Hart, H.L.A., Positivism and the separation of law and morals (1958) Harv Law Rev, 79, pp. 593-607. , 10.2307/1338225; Hitchcock, D., Verheij, B., (2006) Arguing on the Toulmin Model, , Springer Dordrecht 10.1007/978-1-4020-4938-5; Hurley, S., Coherence, hypothetical cases, and precedent (1990) Oxf J Legal Stud, 10, p. 221. , 10.1093/ojls/10.2.221; Johnson, T., (2004) Oral Arguments and Decision Making on the United States Supreme Court, , State University of New York Albany; Lakatos, I., (1976) Proofs and Refutations, , Cambridge University Press London 0334.00022; Levi, E., (1949) An Introduction to Legal Reasoning, , University Chicago Press Chicago; Lynch, C., Ashley, K., Pinkwart, N., Aleven, V., Argument diagramming as focusing device: Does it scaffold reading?

In much AI & Law research, the formalization of arguments, rules and cases has been investigated. In this paper, the tight formal connections between the three are developed further, in an attempt to show that cases can provide the logical basis for establishing which rules and arguments hold in a domain. We use the recently proposed formalism of case models, that has been applied previously to evidential reasoning and ethical systems design. In the present paper, we discuss with respect to case-based modeling how the analogy and distinction between cases can be modeled, and how arguments can be grounded in cases. With respect to rule-based modeling, we discuss conditionality, generality and chaining. With respect to argument-based modeling, we discuss rebutting, undercutting and undermining attack. We evaluate the approach by developing a case model of the rule-based arguments and attacks in Dutch tort law. In this way, we illustrate how statutory, rule-based law from the civil law tradition can be formalized in terms of cases. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Argumentation; Case-based reasoning; Rule-based reasoning","Artificial intelligence; Argumentation; Case based; Civil laws; Evidential reasoning; Legal arguments; Rule based; Rule based reasoning; Rule-based models; Case based reasoning","Al-Abdulkarim, L., Atkinson, K., Bench-Capon, T., Factors, issues and values: Revisiting reasoning with cases (2015) Proceedings of The 15th International Conference on Articial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL 2015), pp. 3-12. , ACM, New York New York; Aleven, V., Ashley, K.D., Doing things with factors (1995) Proceedings of The Fifth International Conference on Articial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL 1995), pp. 31-41. , ACM Press, New York; Ashley, K.D., (1990) Modeling Legal Arguments: Reasoning with Cases and Hypotheticals, , The MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts; Asser, C., Hartkamp, A.F., (1998) Mr. C.

It is in the interests of all parties to a construction contract to avoid litigation. A tool (Ant Miner) is proposed to predict the outcome of construction litigation, hence encouraging the parties to settle out of court. Ant Miner, a rule-based classification system extracts classification rules by using ant colony optimization. It is used on 151 Illinois circuit court cases filed in the period 1987-2005. The prediction model is composed of data consolidation, attribute selection, classification and assessment. The results provide evidence that Ant Miner performs better than models used in earlier studies and that the rule sets discovered by this tool are highly interpretable, but that this tool suffers a great deal from noisy data. If the parties involved in a dispute have access to the proposed system that predicts the decision of the courts with higher accuracy and reliability than before, then they are expected to avoid litigation and settle out of court in order to save considerable time, money and aggravation.","Ant colony algorithm; Artificial intelligence; Case-based reasoning; Decision trees; Litigation; Neural networks","Ant colony algorithm; Ant-colony optimization; Attribute selection; Classification rules; Construction contract; Construction litigation; Court case; Illinois; Litigation; Noisy data; Prediction model; Prediction systems; Rule set; Rule-based classification system; Algorithms; Construction industry; Decision trees; Mathematical models; Miners; Neural networks; Optimization; Case based reasoning; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; construction industry; legal system; optimization; prediction","AbouRizk, S.M., Dozzi, S.P., Application of computer simulation in resolving construction disputes (1993) ASCE Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 119 (2), pp. 355-373; Adeli, H., Wu, M.Y., Regularization neural network for construction cost estimation (1998) ASCE Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 124 (1), pp. 18-24; Amenu, G.G., Markus, M., Kumar, P., Demissie, M., Hydrologic applications of MRAN algorithm (2007) ASCE Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, 12 (1), pp. 124-129; An, S., Park, U., Kang, K., Cho, M., Cho, H., Application of support vector machines in assessing conceptual cost estimates (2007) ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 21 (4), pp. 259-264; Arditi, D., Pulket, T., Predicting the outcome of construction litigation using boosted decision trees (2005) ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 19 (4), pp. 387-393; Arditi, D., Tokdemir, O.B., A comparison of case-based reasoning and artificial neural networks (1999) ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 13 (3), pp. 162-169; Arditi, D., Tunca, A.A., Yuyan, R., Analysis of construction claims that lead to litigation (1995) Proceedings of the International Symposium on Modern Project Management, the International Project Management Association and Russian Project Management Association, , St Petersburg, Russia; Arditi, D., Oksay, F.E., Tokdemir, O.B., Predicting the outcome of construction litigation using neural networks (1998) Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 13 (2), pp. 75-81; Bairaktaris, D., Delis, V., Emmanouilidis, C., Frondistou-Yannas, C., Gratsias, K., Kallidromitis, V., Rerras, N., Decision-support system for the rehabilitation of deteriorating sewers (2007) Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities, 21 (3), pp. 240-248; Bonabeau, E., Dorigo, M., Theraulaz, G., (1999) Swarm Intelligence: From Natural to Artificial System, , Oxford University Press, New York; Cheung, S.O., Tam, C.M., Harris, F.C., Project dispute resolution satisfaction classification through neural network (2000) ASCE Journal of Management in Engineering, 16 (1), pp. 70-79; Deka, P., Chandramouli, V., Fuzzy neural network model for hydrologic flow routing (2005) ASCE Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, 10 (4), pp. 302-314; Diaz, F., Fdez-Riverola, F., Corchado, J.M., Gene-CBR: A case-based reasoning tool for cancer diagnosis using microarray datasets (2006) Computational Intelligence, 22 (3), pp. 254-268; Diekmann, J.E., Girard, M.J., Are contract disputes predictable?

If the case at hand is analogous to a settled case, then by judicial authority one can argue that the settled case should be followed. Case-based reasoning is a topic where ontology meets logic since one's conception of cases determines one's conception of reasoning with cases. In the paper, it is shown how reasoning with cases can be modelled by comparing the corresponding dialectical arguments. A unique characteristic thereby is the explicit recognition that it is in principle contingent which case features are relevant for case comparison. This contigency gives rise to some typical reasoning patterns. The present work is compared to other existing approaches to reasoning by case comparison, and some work on legal ontologies is briefly discussed regarding the role attributed to cases. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Ontology; Contigency; Explicit recognition; Legal ontology; Reasoning patterns; Case based reasoning","Aleven, V., Ashley, K.D., Evaluating a Learning Environment for Case-Based Argumentation Skills (1997) Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 170-179. , New York: ACM Press; Aleven, V., How Different Is Different?

This new reality, however, has not been so rapidly followed by the entities responsible for dealing with the conflicts that arise from these interactions, now undertaken in an electronic format. Traditional paper-based courts, designed for the industrial era, are now outdated. The answer to this problem may rely on the new tools that can be built using new artifacts from fields such as Artificial Intelligence. Using these tools the parties can simulate outcomes, thus having a better notion of the possible consequences of a legal dispute, namely in terms of the Best and Worst Alternative to Negotiated Agreements. In this paper, we present our agent-based architecture for such a tool, UMCourt, placing special emphasis on a particular agent that, based on the concept of legal precedent, gives its users a set of possible outcomes of a case, based on the observation of past similar cases and learns new cases in order to enrich its knowledge base about the Portuguese labor law. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

Although there is a wide range of techniques available, numerous studies have shown that practitioners rely only on a few techniques. The research presented in this paper has developed a framework for breaking down risk management problems. Assessing 179 examples in the literature against this framework, a library has been created that combines techniques with given problem characteristics. Case-based reasoning (CBR) uses the principle of human reasoning as a methodology for solving problems by matching new cases to similar historic cases. This research has used the similarity measuring capability of CBR to propose risk techniques for new situations. It has been shown through CBR that risk management problems can be defined by a combination of political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors with fuzziness, incompleteness and randomness. A tool has been created that can suggest the most appropriate risk technique to be used for a given situation. Validation has shown that the recommended techniques are the most appropriate, on the basis of the case-base, more than 90% of the time. This work shows the applicability of CBR to the risk management problem and, by exploring the heuristic parameters of CBR, adds to the knowledge base in this type of modelling. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Artificial intelligence; Built environment; Case-based reasoning; Risk management; Risk techniques","Built environment; CBr; Construction projects; Environmental factors; Heuristic parameters; Human reasoning; Knowledge base; Risk management techniques; Similarity measuring; Artificial intelligence; Bits; Construction industry; Environmental regulations; Knowledge based systems; Risk management; Case based reasoning; artificial intelligence; construction; heuristics; risk assessment","Akintoye, A.S., Macleod, M.J., Risk analysis and management in construction (1997) International Journal of Project Management, 15 (1), pp. 31-38; Allan, N., Davis, J., Godfrey, P., Ten steps to managing strategic risk-a holistic approach (2007) Proceedings of The ICE: Civil Engineering, 160 (3), pp. 137-143; Andrade, J.C.R., Bento, J., Virtuoso, F., Design of highway bridges: Natural place for CBR (2003) Journal of Computing In Civil Engineering, 17 (3), pp. 167-179; Arditi, D., Tokdemir, O.B., Using case-based reasoning to predict the outcome of construction litigation (1999) Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 14, pp. 385-393; Bajaj, D., Oluwoye, J., Lenard, D., An analysis of contractors' approaches to risk identification in New South Wales, Australia (1997) Construction Management and Economics, 15 (4), pp. 363-369; Blockley, D., Process re-engineering for safety (1995) Risk Management in Civil, Mechanical and Structural Engineering, pp. 51-66. , M.

The paper gives an informal exposition of one particular way to deal with QCR, based on the author's previous work on reason-based logic (RBL). Then it contains a substantially adapted formalisation of RBL, to make RBL suitable for dealing with QCR.

Our system utilizes documents of closed lawsuits as training data for generating keyword-based and case-based classification criteria, and applies these machine-generated criteria for the classification tasks. To construct databases of the classification criteria, we employ different levels of lexical knowledge in extracting information from legal documents in Chinese, and build a case instance for each closed lawsuit. Experimental results indicate that case-based classification outperforms keyword-based classification, and that machine-generated cases may offer performance accuracy that is about 7% below that of human-provided cases. Hoping to boost inference efficiency of our classifiers, we also design methods that merge the machine-generated criteria. Empirical results show that our methods can maintain the classification quality within 20% of the quality achieved by human-provided cases, even when we aggressively reduce the number of previously machine-generated cases by about seventy percents.","case classification; case clustering; case-based reasoning; chinese legal information system; k-nearest neighbor; rule-based reasoning","Case classification; case clustering; chinese legal information system; K-nearest neighbors; Rule based reasoning; Artificial intelligence; Crime; Information retrieval systems; Information systems; Machine design; Case based reasoning","http://wjirs.judicial.gov.tw/jirs/, The following websites provide legal information for Taiwan and China as of May 20, 2003.

Our initial results show that the system based on the argumentation approach improves on the machine learning results in terms of accuracy, and can explain its outcomes in terms of the issue on which the case turned, and the factors that were crucial in arriving at the conclusion. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.","Abstract Dialectical Frameworks; Explanation; Legal case-based reasoning","Computational methods; Machine learning; Turing machines; Human rights; Legal case; Machine learning approaches; Social aspects","Ashley, K.D., Case-based models of legal reasoning in a civil law context (2004) International Congress of Comparative Cultures and Legal Systems of the Instituto de Investigaciones Juŕidicas, pp. 1-30. , Universidad Na-cional Autonoma de México Mexico City;; MacCormick, D.N., Summers, R.S., Goodhart, A.L., (2016) Interpreting Precedents: A Comparative Study, , Routledge;; McCarty, L.T., Reflections on taxman: An experiment in artificial intelligence and legal reasoning (1976) Harvard Law Review., 90, p. 837; Rissland, E.L., Ashley, K.D., A case-based system for trade secrets law (1987) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 60-66; Bench-Capon, T., Hypo's legacy: Introduction to the virtual special issue (2017) Artificial Intelligence and Law., 25 (2), pp. 1-46; Prakken, H., A tool in modelling disagreement in law: Preferring the most specific argument (1991) Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law;, pp. 165-174; Brüninghaus, S., Ashley, K.D., Predicting outcomes of case based legal arguments (2003) Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 233-242; Atkinson, K., Bench-Capon, T., Reasoning with legal cases: Analogy or rule application?

Insider-perpetrated computer crime is committed by individuals who have permission to use a system, and it is, therefore, based on the actions of trusted users. Most information walks out the front door, not through the firewall. This paper presents a theoretical model for analyzing human behavior according to an organization's compliance with legal, institutional, and organizational laws. The theory uses case-based reasoning (CBR) technologies in conjunction with directed acyclic graphs (DAG) and a Hamming similarity function. Defined paths and path deviations in the graphs can be classified to answer automated questions (W7) regarding compliance. The procedure for this model is borrowed from criminology and is referred to as compliance profiling. © 2010 IEEE.","CBR; Compliance profiling; DAG; Insider threat; Privacy","Activity monitoring; CBr; Data loss; Directed acyclic graphs; Fraud detection; Human behaviors; Insider Threat; Insider trading; Similarity functions; Theoretical models; Behavioral research; Computer crime; Crime; Loss prevention; Case based reasoning","Von Solms, S.H., Information security - The fourth wave (2006) Computers & Security, 25 (3), pp. 165-168; Robinson, T., Data security in the age of compliance (2005) NetWorker, 9 (3), pp. 24-30; Yan, W., Hou, E.S.H., Ansari, N., Frame-based attack representation and real-time first order logic automatic reasoning (2005) ITRE, pp. 225-229; Boral, L., Disla, M., Patil, S., Williams, J., Park, J.S., Countering insider threats in personal devices (2007) ISI, p. 365; Information security management systems - Requirements (2005) Information Technology of Security Techniques, , SC27, ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Beuth-Verlag, Berlin, 10; Theoharidou, M., Kokolakis, S., Karyda, M., Kiountouzis, E.A., The insider threat to information systems and the effectiveness of iso17799 (2005) Computers & Security, 24 (6), pp. 472-484; Code of practice for information security management (2005) Information Technology of Security Techniques, , SC27, ISO/IEC 17799:2005, Beuth-Verlag, Berlin, 2nd. ed. 06; Spitzner, L., Honeypots: Catching the insider threat (2003) ACSAC '03: Proceedings of the 19th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, p. 170. , (Washington, DC, USA), IEEE Computer Society; (2009) 19th International Conference On, Intruders Pattern Identification, , Pattern Recognition, 2008.

Our analysis involves the production of what we term 'argument component trees' (ACTs) in which the issues, facts and factors, and the relationship between these, are made explicit. We show how such ACTs can be constructed by identifying the speech acts that are used by the counsel and Justices within their dialogue. We illustrate the application of our analysis by applying it to the oral hearing that took place for the case of Carney v. California, and we relate the majority and minority opinions delivered in that case to our ACTs.

The Android platform employs permission mechanism to protect intensive information from illegal leakage. There are several tools to assist users to manage apps' permissions, such as App Ops, Privacy Guard, and XPrivacy. However, the permission mechanism of Android is complicated, and only a few of smartphone users are familiar with Android security mechanism. In addition, it is difficult for smartphone users to know whether the privacy information exposure by Android applications is legal or not. Reverse engineering and program data flow analysis are basic approaches to analysis applications. Although it needs analysts to manual analysis results, its efficiency is largely depends on analysts' skills and experience. To improve analysis efficiency, we take a case-based reasoning method to simulation the security expert analysis applications. We translate the result of Android static analysis tools into cases and build a case reasoning library. Experiments show that it can help analysts to aid analysis Android applications. © 2015 IEEE.","Android; case based reasoning; privacy leakage; security; static analysis","Android (operating system); Application programs; Case based reasoning; Cloud computing; Data flow analysis; Efficiency; Reverse engineering; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Static analysis; Android; Android applications; Android securities; Context- awareness; Privacy information; Privacy leakages; Private information; security; Mobile security","Amadeo, R., (2013) App Ops: Android 4.3's Hidden App Permission Manager, Control Permissions for Individual Apps!, , http//www.androidpolice.com/2013/07/25/app-ops-android-4-3shidden-apppermission-manager-control-permissionsfor-individualapps; Nguyen, P.Q., Can we trust cryptographic software cryptographic flaws in gnu privacy guard v1. 2.3 (2004) Advances in Cryptology-EUROCRYPT, pp. 555-570. , Springer, Conference Proceedings; (2015) XPrivacy Home Page,[Online; Accessed 19-July-2015], , https//github.com/M66B/XPrivacy; Enck, W., Gilbert, P., Han, S., Tendulkar, V., Chun, B.-G., Cox, L.P., Jung, J., Sheth, A.N., Taintdroid: An informationflow tracking system for realtime privacy monitoring on smartphones (2014) ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), 32 (2), p. 5; Rastogi, V., Chen, Y., Enck, W., Appsplayground: Automatic security analysis of smartphone applications Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy.

In the civil law tradition, legal reasoning on the basis of such a code would be deductive in the sense of the application of rules that are posited prior to the cases to which they should be applied. In the common law tradition, the starting point of legal reasoning is in the cases themselves. As a consequence, common law reasoning would abstract less from the peculiarities of individual cases. The main point of this paper is that Legrand's picture of civil law reasoning is based on the subsumption model of rule application, which does not allow adaptation of the law to the needs of concrete cases other than through the limited possibilities of interpretation. It is argued that this picture is wrong. As an alternative, the reason-based model of rule application is proposed, which allows legal decision makers much more leeway to tailor the law to the needs of concrete cases. In a comparison with case-based reasoning it is argued that rule-based reasoning, according to the reason-based model, gives the decision maker the same leeway. The final conclusion is that possible differences in legal culture between the civil law and the common law tradition are not rooted in the distinction between rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning, and are therefore merely contingent. There is no reason why the introduction of a European Civil Code could not overcome the differences between the two traditions. Whether this would be desirable is a different question. © 2003 SAGE Publications.",,,,"Hage, J.; Maastricht UniversityNetherlands",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",1023263X,,,,"English","Maastricht J.

Precedents (statements from prior cases) play an important role in The Common Law system, where lawyers need to frequently refer to relevant prior cases. Measuring document similarity is one of the most crucial aspects of any document retrieval system which decides the speed, scalability and accuracy of the system. Text-based and network-based methods for computing similarity among case reports have already been proposed in prior works but not without a few pitfalls. Since legal citation networks are generally highly disconnected, network based metrics are not suited for them. Till date, only a few text-based and predominant embedding based methods have been employed, for instance, TF-IDF based approaches, Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013) and Doc2Vec (Le and Mikolov 2014) based approaches. We investigate the performance of 56 different methodologies for computing textual similarity across court case statements when applied on a dataset of Indian Supreme Court Cases. Among the 56 different methods, thirty are adaptations of existing methods and twenty-six are our proposed methods. The methods studied include models such as BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) and Law2Vec (Ilias 2019). It is observed that the more traditional methods (such as the TF-IDF and LDA) that rely on a bag-of-words representation performs better than the more advanced context-aware methods (like BERT and Law2Vec) for computing document-level similarity. Finally we nominate, via empirical validation, five of our best performing methods as appropriate for measuring similarity between case reports. Among these five, two are adaptations of existing methods and the other three are our proposed methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","BERT; Court case reports; Court case similarity; Doc2vec; Law2vec; Legal information retrieval; Topic modeling; Word2vec","Artificial intelligence; Management; Citation networks; Document similarity; Empirical validation; Legal documents; Legal information retrieval; Measuring similarities; Textual similarities; Unsupervised approaches; Information retrieval","Learning robust, transferable sentence representations for text classification (2018) Corr Abs/1810.00681, 1810, p. 00681; Etc: Encoding long and structured inputs in transformers (2020) Arxiv2004.08483; Backstrom, L., Kleinberg, J., Romantic partnerships and the dispersion of social ties: A network analysis of relationship status on facebook (2014) Proc.

The act of hiding property seriously affects people’s legitimate rights and interests and China’s legal authority. Therefore, it is essential to find an effective method of analyzing whether a judgment debtor hides property. Aiming at the hidden property analysis problem, we propose a case-based reasoning method for the judgment debtor’s hidden property analysis. In the hidden property analysis process, we present the attributes of the enforcement case by crisp symbols, crisp numbers, interval numbers, and fuzzy linguistic variables and develop a hybrid similarity measure between the historical enforcement case and the target enforcement case. The results show that the recommendations obtained with the information and knowledge of similar historical cases are consistent with judicial practice, which can reduce the work pressure of law enforcement officers and improve the efficiency of handling enforcement cases. © 2021 by the authors.

The rapid uptake of wearables and connected diagnostic devices adds another source of densely collected data by the patients themselves. Integration of these data sources opens up several potentials: a longitudinal view of laboratory findings would close the gaps between individual provider visits and allow to more closely follow disease progression. Adding non-laboratory data (e.g. diagnoses, procedures) would add context and support clinical interpretation of findings. Case-based reasoning and disease-modelling approaches would allow to identify similar patient groups and classify endotypes. Realization of these potentials is, however, subject to several barriers, including legal and ethical prerequisites of data access, syntactic and semantic integration, comparability of items and user-centered presentation. The German Medical Informatics Initiative is presented as a current undertaking that strives to address these issues by establishing a national infrastructure for the secondary use of routine clinical data. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.","electronic patient record; secondary use; systems integration","access to information; Conference Paper; disease exacerbation; electronic patient record; human; information processing; laboratory; machine learning; medical care; medical informatics; priority journal; health care delivery; laboratory; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Laboratories; Medical Informatics","Schusselé Filliettaz, S., Berchtold, P., Kohler, D., Peytremann-Bridevaux, I., Integrated care in Switzerland: Results from the first nationwide survey (2018) Health Policy, 122, pp. 568-576; Lang, C., Gottschall, M., Sauer, M., Köberlein-Neu, J., Bergmann, A., Voigt, K., Interface problems between inpatient, GP and outpatient specialist care: Viewpoint of general practitioners in Dresden (2018) Gesundheitswesen; Pain, T., Kingston, G., Askern, J., Smith, R., Phillips, S., Bell, L., How are allied health notes used for inpatient care and clinical decisionmaking?

But in most instances, people have a specific purpose to their activity with data that drives the process. They often have particular questions that need answering in support of some broader investigation. These questions often change as answers point in various directions during an investigation, whether the investigation is formal (e.g., scientific, legal, journalistic, or military) or simply an informal browsing of the internet. In this paper, we take a mixed-initiative approach to knowledge discovery, and we present a system called Kyudo that supports the process using a conversational case-based reasoning process. Cases in Kyudo are sequences of knowledge goals or questions that form arcs through a multidimensional knowledge space and that form the core activity in a dialogue between the user and system. As the system gains more experience and therefore more cases, it is able to detect similarity in knowledge goals and prompt the user with additional relevant goals that can short circuit the human reasoning process to minimize tangents or false starts. In this paper we present a distance-based mechanism that reduces the total length of a goal trajectory through guidance that accelerates the human reasoning process and aids effective knowledge discovery.

A technical challenge is posed by the right of patients to withdraw permission to disseminate their images or videos. A technical mechanism for spreading information about changes in multimedia usage licenses is sought. The authors gained their experience by developing and managing a large (>340 cases) repository of virtual patients within the European project eViP. The solution for dissemination of license status should reuse and extend existing metadata standards in medical education. Two methods: PUSH and PULL are described differing in the moment of update and the division of responsibilities between parties in the learning object exchange process. The authors recommend usage of the PUSH scenario because it is better adapted to legal requirements in many countries. It needs to be stressed that the solution is based on mutual trust of the exchange partners and therefore is most appropriate for use in educational alliances and consortia. It is hoped that the proposed models for exchanging consents and licensing information will become a crucial part of the technical frameworks for building case-based repositories. © 2011 European Federation for Medical Informatics.

When such cases go to high courts, judges may handle these counterintuitive consequences by identifying problematic rule conditions. Given that the law consists of a large number of rule conditions, it is demanding and exhaustive to figure out which condition is problematic. For solving this problem, our work aims to assist judges in civil law systems to resolve counterintuitive consequences using logic program representation of statutes and Legal Debugging. The core principle of Legal Debugging is to cooperate with a user to find a culprit, a root cause of counterintuitive consequences. This article proposes an algorithm to resolve a culprit. Since the statutes are represented by logic rules but changes in law are initiated by cases, we adopt a prototypical case with judgement specified by a set of rules.

In front-end web development parts of available solutions cannot be reused directly, due to technical and legal obstacles, so we propose a specific process to generate web user interfaces (WUI) designs from configurable components. The similarity between the generated designs and the exemplary high-quality solutions retrieved from case base is then optimized within the evolutionary algorithm. In our current paper we designate the structure of the components and justify the employment of Drupal as the organizational framework. We also describe the implementation details, including the two supplemental software tools that we developed: 1) web intelligence miner that collects website-related data from linked open data sources and 2) web UI screenshot analyzer that converts it into semantic-spatial representation in JSON format. Finally, we specify the new solutions generation algorithm, per the three WUI dimensions: Functionality, layout and visual appearance. © 2018 IEEE.","case-based reasoning; evolutionary algorithms; software components; user interface design; web engineering","Case based reasoning; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Semantics; Software design; Websites; Component based approach; Component-based engineering; Evolutionary optimizations; Organizational frameworks; Software component; User interface designs; Web development frameworks; Web engineering; User interfaces","Glass, R.L., (2002) Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering, , Addison-Wesley Professional; Mantaras, R.L., Retrieval, reuse, revision and retention in case-based reasoning (2005) The Knowledge Engineering Review, 20 (3), pp. 215-240; Rocha, R.G., Azevedo, R.R., Sousa, Y.C., Tavares, E.D.A., Meira, S., A case-based reasoning system to support the global software development (2014) Procedia Computer Science, 35, pp. 194-202; De Renzis, A., Garriga, M., Flores, A., Cechich, A., Zunino, A., Casebased reasoning for web service discovery and selection (2016) Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, 321, pp. 89-112; Marir, F., Case-based reasoning for an adaptive web user interface (2012) The Int Conf on Computing, Networking and Digital Technologies (ICCNDT2012), pp. 306-315; Bakaev, M., Assessing similarity for case-based web user interface design Proc.

Common Law Systems around the world recognize the importance of precedence in Law. In making decisions, Judges are obliged to consult prior cases that had already been decided to ensure that there is no divergence in treatment of similar situations in different cases. Our approach was to investigate the effectiveness of using legal catchphrases in precedence retrieval. To improve retrieval performance, we incorporated term dependency in our retrieval. In addition, we investigate the effects of deploying query expansion on the retrieval performance. Our results show an improvement in the retrieval performance when we incorporate term dependence in scoring and ranking prior cases. However, we see a degradation in the retrieval performance when we deploy query expansion.","Legal catch-phrases; Precedent retrieval; Query expansion; Term dependency","Expansion; Fires; Common law; Legal catch-phrases; Legal documents; Making decision; Precedent retrieval; Query expansion; Retrieval performance; Term dependency; Information retrieval","Amati, G., (2003) Probabilistic Models for Information Retrieval Based on Divergence from Randomness, pp. 1-198. , University of Glasgow, UK, PhD Thesis (June 2003); Amati, G., Ambrosi, E., Bianchi, M., Gaibisso, C., Gambosi, G., FUB, IASI-CNR and university of tor vergata at TREC 2007 blog track (2007) Proceedings of the 16th Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-2007), pp. 1-10. , Text REtrieval Conference (TREC), Gaithersburg, Md., USA; Mandal, A., Ghosh, K., Bhattacharya, A., Pal, A., Ghosh, S., Overview of the FIRE 2017 track: Information retrieval from legal documents (IRLeD) (2017) Working Notes of FIRE 2017 - Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (CEUR Workshop Proceedings), , CEUR-WS.org; Metzler, D., Bruce Croft, W., A Markov random field model for term dependencies (2005) Proceedings of the 28th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR '05), pp. 472-479. , https://doi.org/10.1145/1076034.1076115, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Ramos, J., (1999) Using TF-IDF to Determine Word Relevance in Document Queries, , 1999; Thuma, E., Motlogelwa, N.P., Leburu-Dingalo, T., UB-Botswana participation to CLEF eHealth IR challenge 2017: Task 3 (IRTask1: Adhoc search) (2017) Working Notes of CLEF 2017 - Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum, , http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1866/paper_73.pdf, Dublin, Ireland, September 11-14, 2017",,"Majumder P.Sankhavara J.Mitra M.Mehta P.","CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041437176

Although those policies have achieved a degree of success in fostering entrepreneurs and developing human networks, some remaining problems have been pointed out regarding the fact that the policy target of sustainable revitalization of regions has not been realized. In this Paper, we report an interim result of the project aims to develop a decision-making support system with applied case-based reasoning to contribute to the resolution of these problems. Case-based reasoning is a technique for problem-solving based on the solution of similar past cases. The system of reasoning has been put to practical use in engineering problem-solving, diagnosis, decision making on managerial issues, legal reasoning and so on. By applying the technique of planning and problem-solving to regional science, technology and innovation policy, the sharing of useful knowledge for regional revitalization among regions becomes possible. The scheme of this project includes a large-scale acquisition of case information, construction of database, analyses of success factors of policies, and the development of rules of inference and their implementation. © 2014 PICMET.",,"Decision making; Laws and legislation; Case based reasoning systems; Case informations; Decision making support system; Engineering problem solving; Science and Technology; Science and technology policy; Success factors; Technology and Innovation Policy; Case based reasoning","Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approach (1994) Artificial Intelligence Communications, 7 (1), pp. 39-59; (2008) Strategy of Local Revitalization Through Science and Technology, , http://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/output/080519iken-4.pdf, Council for Science and Technology Policy (in Japanese); Jiang, J., Harayama, Y., The development of regional science and technology policy in japan, in contrast with the us and eu (2005) The Journal of Science Policy and Research Management, 20 (1), pp. 63-77. , (in Japanese); Richter, M.M., Aamodt, A., Case-based reasoning foundations (2006) The Knowledge Engineering Review, 20 (3), pp. 203-207","Nagata, A.; Center for Science, Japan","Kocaoglu D.F.Anderson T.R.Daim T.U.Kozanoglu D.C.Niwa K.Perman G.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781890843304,,,"English","PICMET - Portland Int.

Gray Cygnets follow a Black Swan, are highly similar to it, are also exceptional in outcome, and continue to provoke change. We discuss experiments with a family of tests designed to detect Gray Cygnet (GC) cases in a stream of cases following a known Black Swan case. Using the two classic CBR measures of lattice-based and nearest neighbor similarity, the tests use positional information about the Black Swan in the analysis of a new case, such as its being a supreme on-point case (sopc), a Level 1 (L1) case, or in the first ring of nearest neighbors (NN#1), to determine if it is a potential GC. The idea is that a case very similar to a known Black Swan might be a GC. Experiments performed on a corpus of cases from a well-known episode in legal history spanning the era from mid-1800's to mid-1900's showed tests using sopc's were very precise, while those using L1 cases had good recall. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Black Swans; Case Similarity; Case-Based Reasoning; Classification tests; Gray Cygnets; Supreme on-point case (sopc); Surprising cases","Black Swans; Case Similarity; Classification tests; Gray Cygnets; Supreme on-point case (sopc); Surprising cases; Artificial intelligence; Experiments","Aleven, V., Using background knowledge in case-based legal reasoning: A computational model and an intelligent tutoring environment (2003) Artificial Intelligence, 150 (1-2), p. 183; Ashley, K.D., (1990) Modeling Legal Argument: Reasoning with Cases and Hypotheticals, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Bohlen, F.H., (1905) The Basis of Affirmative Obligations in the Law of Tort, , American Law Register; Bohlen, F.H., Fifty Years of Tort (1937) Harv.

The purpose of this method is to capture information necessary for automated inferences about the strength of existing legal authority in favor of, or against, proposed statements of law. This data would have two potential uses. First, from the point of view of a given court and date, it would be possible to resolve the authority status of each legal rule, thus resolving conflicts between contradictory rules. Second, if the set of legal rules applicable to a particular court could be determined, it would be possible to apply those rules in a simulation of litigation in that court. The paper provides an example of authority-based reasoning by modeling rules from two cases about suppression of evidence derived from warrantless searches and seizures, and then demonstrating simple inferences about the status of those rules in federal and state courts in California. © 2011 ACM.","case-based reasoning; legal authority; legal knowledge representation; precedent; rule-based reasoning","California; Common law; Contradictory rules; legal authority; Legal knowledge representation; Legal rules; precedent; Rule based reasoning; Artificial intelligence; Knowledge representation; Laws and legislation","Aleveri, V., Using background knowledge in case-based legal reasoning: A computational model and an intelligent learning environment (2003) Artificial Intelligence, 150, pp. 183-237; Bench-Capon, T., Coenen, F., Isomorphisrn and legal knowledge based systems (1992) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 1 (1), pp. 65-86; Bench-Capon, T., Gordon, T., Isomorphism and angumentation (2009) Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL '09).

The analogy reasoning mode, naturally used in the legal domain, possesses a variant, called case-based reasoning (CBR). It consists in solving a new problem by reusing the solution of a similar problem already met, and stored in a memory of cases. Numerous applications based on this new paradigm have been developed in both CBR problem-solving style (dealing with cognitive tasks like diagnosis, planning,...) and interpretative style (used in interpretation, justification, or projection). Interpretative case-based reasoning is a process of assessment of situations or solutions in a previous experience context. It is naturally daily used. Indeed, judges in their courthouses interpret a new situation in the light of case already met (case of jurisprudence). In the following, we are interested in applying this style of reasoning in the Islamic legislation field as a tool for information retrieval, which can be used during the process of Fatwa generation. In Islamic legislation, the Fatwa consists in the declaration of a legal opinion in respect of the Islamic precepts. El Bayane is a CBR system conceived to help a Mufti in generating Fatwas for the new situations, by using the Fatwas of past situations. It is not able to generate a new Fatwa from scratch, but it reuses the Fatwas, by imitating an imam.","Artificial Intelligence; Case Based Reasoning; Decision support; Information Retrieval; Islamic legislation",,"Haton, J.-P., (1992) Le Raisonnement en IA, , Paris Interédition; Ashley, K.D., Rissland, E.L., A case based approach to modelling legal expertise (1988) IEEE Expert, 3 (3), pp. 70-77; Rissland, E., Skalak, D., Case based reasoning in a rule governed domain (1989) Proceedings of the 5th Conference on AI Applications, , City; Rougegrez-Loriette, S., (1994) Prédiction de Processus à Partir de Comportements Observés: Le Système REBECAS, , Thèse de Doctorat D'université.

Traditional Nearest-Neighbour (NN) matching has shown that it is not capable of dealing with the situations that the values of weights or dimensional matching scores are extremely high or low. These extreme situations have nonlinear psychological effects on the aggregate marching scores. Generalized Nearest-Neighbour (GNN) matching improved NN matching in certain situations, but it is not generally applicable and it can cause an unexpected ranking. In order to improve the limitation of NN matching and complement the deficiency of GNN matching, we propose a novel Nonlinear Nearest-Neighbour (NNN) matching function based on the adjustments for nonlinear effects and the fuzzy logic inference.

The usability of such systems depends on the terms used in the law being represented: often only users familiar with the practice and application of the law will be able to provide the required information. Earlier work applied this approach to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Although the performance of the tool built for that domain was good, the questions posed to the user demanded a good deal of knowledge and experience of the ECHR. Here we use the knowledge of an expert with extensive experience of the ECHR to extend the model, through intermediate levels, to identify questions that are appropriate to the target user. We have undertaken a pilot evaluation in which a small number of lawyers have used the prototype program and provided very positive feedback, showing that they are receptive to AI solutions that give effective, explainable decision support. © 2021 ACM.","ADFs; case-based reasoning; ECHR; explainability","Decision support systems; Laws and legislation; Decision supports; Executable model; Formal model; Human rights; Intermediate level; Knowledge and experience; Legal supports; Artificial intelligence","Al-Abdulkarim, L., Atkinson, K., Bench-Capon, T., A methodology for designing systems to reason with legal cases using ADFs (2016) AI and Law, 24 (1), pp. 1-49. , 2016; Aletras, N., Tsarapatsanis, D., Preotiuc-Pietro, D., Lampos, V., Predicting judicial decisions of the European court of human rights: A natural language processing perspective (2016) Peer J Computer Science, 2, p. e93. , 2016; Aleven, V., (1997) Teaching Case-based Argumentation through a Model and Examples, , Ph.D. thesis.

A novel system called RYEL was developed based on Subject-Matter Experts (SME) to investigate new techniques for acquiring higher-order thinking, the perception, the use of new computational explanatory techniques, support decision-making, and the judge’s cognition and behavior. Thus, a new spectrum is covered and promises to be a new area of study called Interpretation-Assessment/Assessment-Interpretation (IA-AI), consisting of explaining machine inferences and the interpretation and assessment from a human. It allows expressing a semantic, ontological, and hermeneutical meaning related to the psyche of a human (judge). The system has an interpretative and explanatory nature, and in the future, could be used in other domains of discourse. More than 33 experts in Law and Artificial Intelligence validated the functional design. More than 26 judges, most of them specializing in psychology and criminology from Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Spain, Argentina, and Costa Rica, participated in the experiments. The results of the experimentation have been very positive. As a challenge, this research represents a paradigm shift in legal data processing. © 2021 by the authors.

To do this, the choice of an ideal representation is guided by the domain characteristics and the complexity of its cases. Recently, the explosion of deep learning techniques and other forms of vectorised representations, has provided a new source for case insights. Richer text features can be extracted and used for each case if required. In this paper, we build on recent work in this area and generate richer case representation by automatically acquiring domain knowledge from unstructured sentences. We describe how the Deep Knowledge Acquisition Framework obtains its representation vectors from stemmed words and improving these vectors iteratively, suggesting high quality outputs and relevance to domain experts based on either explicit queries or their past intentions. We evaluate these ideas using two, not related, datasets from the automotive and legal domains respectively. The results show the benefits of combining Autoencoders and Siamese Networks in CBR while achieving better textual data dimensionality reduction, data de-noising and similarity measures. © 2019 IEEE.","Autoencoders; Case-based Reasoning; Deep Learning; Multi-lingual Text Analysis; Natural Language Processing; Siamese Networks; Textual CBR","Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Autoencoders; Case representation; Data de-noising; Domain knowledge; Learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Similarity measure; Text analysis; Case based reasoning","Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 1 (7). , March; Jalali, V., Leake, D., CBR meets big data: A case study of large-scale adaptation rule generation (2015) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, pp. 181-196; Daengdej, J., Lukose, D., Tsui, E., Beinat, P., Prophet, L., Dynamically creating indices for two million cases: A real world problem (1996) Advances in Case-Based Reasoning, p. 105119. , Berlin, Springer; Beaver, I., Dumoulin, J., Applying mapreduce to learning user preferences in near realtime (2014) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, ICCBR 2014, p. 1528. , Berlin, Springer; Plaza, E., Semantics and experience in the future web (2008) Proceedings of the Ninth European Conference on Case-Based Reasoning, p. 4458. , Springer; Ontanon, S., Lee, Y.C., Snodgrass, S., Bonfiglio, D., Winston, F., Mc-Donald, C., Gonzalez, A., Case-based prediction of teen driver behavior and skill (2014) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development, ICCBR 2014, p. 375389. , Berlin, Springer; Cordier, A., Lefevre, M., Champin, P.A., Georgeon, O., Mille, A., Tracebased reasoning modeling interaction traces for reasoning on experiences (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Florida AI Research Symposium, p. 363368. , AAAI Press; Amin, K., Kapetanakis, S., Althoff, K.D., Dengel, A., Petridis, M., Answering with cases: A cbr approach to deep learning (2018) Case-Based Reasoning Research and Development.

For countries that adopt the common law system they are often cited in court decisions to argue cases of interest. AILA 2019 track presented two tasks; precedents retrieval task and statutes retrieval task1. Our team participated in the latter. The statutes provided consisted of two components namely; Title and Statute description. In this study we first conduct the experiment to determine the best term weighting model for this task. After determining the best term weighting model, the second set of experiments which aimed to determine the extent to which these components (title and description of statutes) contribute to retrieval ef- fectiveness. To find out how retrieval effectiveness is affected by different components three experiments were conducted; the first involved index- ing title and description of each statute as a document, retrieval us- ing IFB2 is performed generating the first run (Baseline), the second experiment involved indexing only title disregarding description of the statutes, this generate the second run. For the final experiment, only description of statutes are indexed disregarding title, again indexing, re- trieval performed to generate the third run. The three runs were then sent to organisers for evaluation. The evaluation results shows our team came second, furthermore results suggest that indexing with title only and disregarding description of statutes is sufficient enough for retrieval of statutes. © Copyright 2019 for this paper by its authors.","Information Retrieval; Legal Statutes Retrieval; Legal Text Mining","Data mining; Indexing (of information); Comparative approach; Court decisions; Evaluation results; Legal Statutes Retrieval; Legal texts; Retrieval effectiveness; Term weighting; Two-component; Information retrieval","Bhattacharya, P., Ghosh, K., Ghosh, S., Pal, A., Mehta, P., Bhattacharya, A., Ma-Jumder, P., Overview of the FIRE 2019 AILA track: Artiflcial intelligence for legal assistance (2019) Proc. of FIRE 2019-Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, , Kolkata, India, December 12-15; Amati, G., Van Rijsbergen, C.J., Proba-bilistic models of informa-tion retrieval based on measuring the divergence from randomness (2002) ACM Trans.

IRS reduces the efforts of identifying the required information from an enormous database. Legal domain is one of the major producers of complex information which consist of semi-structured and unstructured data. Knowledge based legal information systems are revolutionizing all processes involved in this domain and hence need for more effective legal knowledge management approaches are increasing. This paper proposes association rule mining as knowledge extraction technique that can be used effectively for analyzing relatedness of documents in legal domain.

As number of cases are increasing rapidly, automation becomes highly desirable. This paper presents two such systems viz. Automatic Catchphrase Detection and Automatic Precedence Detection. Automatic Catchphrase Detection: One of the key requirements of such information retrieval system is to pre-populate database of prior cases with catchphrases for better indexing and faster, relevant retrieval. This paper proposes an automatic catchphrases prediction for cases for the same. The problem catchphrase detection has been modeled as ""custom named entity recognition (NER) using conditional random fields (CRF)"". CRF is trained with pairs of prior cases and their respective catchphrases, the gold standards. The model is, then used to predict catch-phases of unseen legal texts. End of the first section demonstrates efficacy of the proposed system using practical data-set. Automatic Precedence Detection: Due to thousands of past cases it becomes tedious and error-prone to find relevant precedent, manually. An automatic precedent retrieval system is the need of the hour. One of the key requirements of such information system is to find cases which could be ""similar"" to the case in hand. The ""similarity"" used in this paper is about citations. The problem is of predicting prior cases which could potentially be cited by a particular case text. This paper proposes such association system using mixed approaches. It employs rule-based Regular Expressions based on references to statute and Articles. It finds cosine similar ity between case susing vector sgenerated by popular word embedding called doc2vec. It also leverages topic modeling by finding matches between cases based on the number of common topic words. End of the second section demonstrates efficacy of the proposed system by generating cite-able documents from test data-set.","Conditional random fields; Information retrieval; Legal; Legal; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Regular expressions; Text mining; Topic modeling; Word embedding; Word2Vec","Character recognition; Computer programming languages; Data mining; Forecasting; Information retrieval; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Pattern matching; Random processes; Statistical tests; Text processing; Conditional random field; Legal; Named entity recognition; Regular expressions; Text mining; Topic Modeling; Word embedding; Word2Vec; Search engines","Edward Loper Bird, S., Klein, E., (2009) Natural Language Toolkit, , http://www.nltk.org/, Sep 2009; (2017) Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, , https://sites.google.com/view/fire2017irled/track-description, IRSI Information Retrival Society of India.

One of the critical application domains is the Islamic Fatawa (religious verdict) domain, which refers to seeking a legal ruling for religious issues that Muslims all over the globe pose on a daily basis. Official religious organizations like Egypt’s Dar al-Ifta1 is responsible for receiving and answering people’s religious inquiries daily. Due to the enormous number of inquiries Dar al-Ifta receives every day, it cannot be handled at the same time. This task actually requires a certain smart system that can help in fulfilling people ’s needs for answers. However, applying TCBR in the domain of issuing Fatawa faces several challenges related to the language syntax and semantics. The contribution of this paper is to propose an intelligent fatwa Questions Answering (QA) system that can overcome the challenges and respond to a user's inquiry through providing semantically closest inquiries that previously answered. Moreover, the paper shows how the proposed system can learn when a new inquiry arrives. Finally, results will be discussed. © 2015, Zarka Private Univ.

Mostly a man with a need for judicial assistance approaches with an advocate to deal with his case, but this may not be useful when a person is interested in knowing and applying the exact law approach to petty issues in his life and also to avoid being a scapegoat at sometimes by few advocates who elongates the case system for his benefits. The proposed approach has an intelligent hybrid agent system composed of two subsystems, law gatherer and law decider to address the two key issues, finding out right laws and making a right choice. The law gatherer subsystem is based on the ontology web service architecture to define the ontology which is used for processing the semantic content of gathered law information. The law gatherer subsystem is composed of a knowledge system that combines Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR). Simple Object Access protocol (SOAP) is used for establishing the communication interface and gathering XML-based contents between the agent system and the database system created, through remote procedure calls with condition parameters. In the second subsystem Law Decider, the Analytic Hierarchy Process which is a structured technique for dealing with complex decisions is used to make an optimal decision for satisfying the case structure of the individual. The proposed Hybrid agent system will assist the people with no judicial knowledge to feed their case details into the system to get the appropriate law suitable for that particular instance. © 2011 IEEE.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Artificial Intelligence; case-based reasoning; Intelligent Agent; Ontology; rule-based systems; Web Service","Agent systems; Case structures; CBr; Communication interface; Complex decision; Condition parameters; Hybrid agents; Knowledge system; Law approach; Legal system; Ontology web services; Optimal decisions; Remote Procedure Call; Rule based reasoning; Rule based system; Semantic content; Simple object access protocols; Analytic hierarchy process; Case based reasoning; Database systems; Hierarchical systems; Intelligent agents; Internet protocols; Laws and legislation; Ontology; Semantic Web; Semantics; User interfaces; Web services; Multi agent systems","Paolucci, M., Srinivasan, Sycara, (2004) OWL Ontology of Web Service Architecture Concepts; Saaty, T.L., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process, , New York:Mc Graw-Hill; Saaty, T.L., (1990) The Analytic Hierarchy Process:Planning PrioritySetting, ResourceAllocation, , 2ndedition.Pittsburgh: RWS Publications; Web Services Architecture (2004) W3C Working Group Note, , World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); Protégé Ontology Editor and Knowledge Acquisition System, , http://protege.stanford.edu; Aleven, V., Using Background knowledge in case based legal reasoning: A computational model and an intelligent learning environment (2003) Artiff.Intell, 150, pp. 183-237; Rissland, E.L., Skalak, D.B., Cabaret:Rule Interpretation in a hybrid architecture (1991) Int.J.Man-Mach.Stud, 34, pp. 839-887; (2003) JESS the Rule Engine for the Java Platform, , http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/; Castillo, E., Gutíerrez, J.M., Hadi, A.S., (1997) Expert Systems and Probabilistic Network Models, , Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., Secaucus, NJ, USA","Cyril Naves, S.; Department of Information Technology, , Chennai, India; email: cyrilnaves91@gmail.com",,,,9781457708787,,,"English","IAMA - Int.

Originally conceived by cognitive scientists, since 1993 the CBR community has focused primarily on issues of interest to artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners. Some research topics of particular interest include case representation and indexing, solution retrieval and adaptation, learning (e.g., case acquisition), and integrating case-based approaches with others. Some motivating applications have included those related to customer support, recommender systems, knowledge management, diagnosis, the health sciences, and legal reasoning. Among these areas, most deployed CBR applications have been for the customer support niche of help-desk systems. These applications have the characteristic that problem descriptions are incrementally elicited from a user rather than available in complete form a priori. This category of CBR approaches is referred to as conversational (Aha et al., 2001) because they use a dialogue with the end user to identify the problem to be solved. Many case-based diagnosis and recommendation systems have used a conversational CBR (CCBR) methodology, and met with considerable success. In this presentation, I will introduce the CCBR methodology, describe its evolution, examine its various manifestations and their motivations, highlight recent work, and describe unsolved issues that could be the focus of enlightened dissertations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"Artificial intelligence researchers; Case-based reasoning (CBR); Conversational case-based reasoning; Help-desk systems; Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Health care; Information retrieval; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge representation; Problem solving; Professional aspects; Research and development management; Speech processing; Formal logic","Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 7, pp. 39-59; Aha, D.W., Breslow, L.A., Munoz-Avila, H., Conversational case-based reasoning (2001) Applied Intelligence, 14 (1), pp. 9-32; Bergmann, R., (2002) Experience Management: Foundations, Development Methodology, and Internet-based Applications, , Berlin: Springer; Kolodner, J., (1993) Case-based Reasoning, , San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufmann; Watson, I., CBR is a methodology not a technology (1999) Knowledge Based Systems Journal, 12 (5-6), pp. 303-308","Aha, D.W.; Intelligent Decision Aids Group, , Washington, DC 20375, United States; email: david.aha@nrl.navy.mil",,,03029743,3540305068; 9783540305064,,,"English","Lect.

In this context, the configure-to-order (CTO) approach allows the user to define the product configuration at the time of the order and the supplier to develop a product that meets the customer's needs. This paper presents an object-oriented knowledge-based system (OOKBS) that integrates rule- and case-based reasoning to verify the compliance of a variant-rich and complex product—electric motors—in a multinational-level company. The system adopts a modular structure to evaluate distinct compliance aspects, such as technical constraints and commercial requirements, and to improve the compliance assessment based on the designs of motors previously sold. The work targeted a product line with significant market share in North America, and is the result of a collaboration among the following teams: product compliance, international sales, engineering systems, and product engineering. In total, the system development involved nine experts from these areas. This study has the originality of presenting a product configuration system (PCS) that integrates rule-based and case-based approaches to verify the compliance of a modular product. The results indicate a reduction of 73% of internal technical queries within the prototype scope. Moreover, the system usability tests highlight the completeness of outcomes, quick access to information, and easy integration of automatic product compliance verification into the company's design flow. Furthermore, we discussed how the system was effectively implemented in a design routine based on both concurrent engineering and CTO scenarios. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","compliance; electric motor; knowledge-based system; product configuration system","Case based reasoning; Commerce; Competition; Compliance control; Concurrent engineering; Electric motors; Product design; Commercial requirements; Compliance; Compliance verification; Configuration system; Customizable products; Knowledge-based systems; Multinational level; Product compliance; Product configuration; Product configuration system; Knowledge based systems","Back, N., Ogliari, A., Dias, A., Silva, J.C., (2008) Projeto integrado de produtos: planejamento, concepção e modelagem, , Manole Publishing Company; Beach, T.H., Rezgui, Y., Li, H., Kasim, T., A rule-based semantic approach for automated regulatory compliance in the construction sector (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42, pp. 5219-5231; (2020) Integration of Configit ACE® and Aras Innovator; Da Xu, L., Wang, C., Bi, Z., Yu, J., Object-oriented templates for automated assembly planning of complex products (2014) IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 11 (2), pp. 492-503; El Kharbili, M., (2012) Business process regulatory compliance management solution frameworks: A comparative evaluation.

However, the formal properties of AA-CBR as a reasoning system remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we focus on analysing the non-monotonicity properties of a regular version of AA-CBR (that we call AA-CBR≽). Specifically, we prove that AA-CBR≽ is not cautiously monotonic, a property frequently considered desirable in the literature. We then define a variation of AA-CBR≽ which is cautiously monotonic. Further, we prove that such variation is equivalent to using AA-CBR≽ with a restricted casebase consisting of all “surprising” and “sufficient” cases in the original casebase. As a by-product, we prove that this variation of AA-CBR≽ is cumulative, rationally monotonic, and empowers a principled treatment of noise in “incoherent” casebases.

Since in this domain, a subjective environmentis presented where the parties have contradictory points of view.

Semantically analyzing the documents is more challenging since it’s often more complicated than open domain documents. Efficient document analysis is crucial to current legal applications, such as case-based reasoning, legal citations, and so on. Due to the extensive growth of documents of data, several statistical machine-learning methods have been developed for Legal documents data analytics. However, documents are large and highly complex, so the traditional machine learning-based classification models are inefficient for accurate data analytics with minimum time. In order to improve the accurate legal documents data analytics with minimum time, an efficient technique called Probit Regressive Tversky Indexed Rocchio Convolutive Deep Neural Learning (PRTIRCDNL) is introduced. The PRTIRCDNL technique uses the Convolutive Deep neural learning concept to learn the given input with help of many layers and provides accurate classification results. Convolutive Deep Neural Learning uses two different processing steps such as keyword extraction and classification in the different layers such as input, two hidden layers and output layer. Initially, large numbers of legal documents are collected from the dataset. Then the collected legal documents are sent to the input layer of the convolutive deep neural learning. The input legal documents are transferred into the first hidden layer where the keyword extraction process is carried out by applying the Target projective probit Regression. Then the regression function extracts the keywords based on frequent occurrence score. Then the extracted keywords are transferred into the second hidden layer where the document classification is performed using the Tversky similarity indexive Rocchio classifier. Likewise, all the legal documents are classified into different classes. The experimental evaluation is carried out using different performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and computational time with respect to the number of legal documents collected from the dataset. The observed results confirmed that the presented PRTIRCDNL technique provides the better performance in terms of achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure with minimum computation time. © 2021, Ismail Saritas.

In this paper, we use a recently developed precedent model formalism to discuss precedent comparison in case-based reasoning. With this formalism and a case study in a real legal domain, we show a new generalization and a new refinement of precedent comparison with respect to case-based reasoning approaches based on factors, such as HYPO and CATO. 1) Generalization: precedents and case facts can now be compared with general propositional formulas, and not only with factors. 2) Refinement: a distinction can be made between current analogies and distinctions in precedent models, and so-called relevances, i.e., unshared formulas between two precedents that are relevant for possible additional analogies and distinctions that can arise in a discussion. With these contributions the role of factors in case-based reasoning can be refined and compound formulas based on factors can be taken into account in case-based reasoning. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.","Case-based reasoning; Precedent comparison; Precedents","Case-based reasoning approaches; Legal case; Legal domains; Modeling formalisms; Propositional formulas; Case based reasoning","Ashley, K.

We develop a system called RYEL based on subject-matter experts about the legal case process, facts, pieces of evidence, and how to analyze the merits of a case. Through this system, we study the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach using Knowledge Graphs (KG) and enforcement unsupervised algorithms which results are expressed in an Explanatory Graphical Interface (EGI). The evidence and facts of a legal case are represented as knowledge graphs. Granular Computing (GrC) techniques are applied in the graph when processing nodes and edges using object types, properties, and relations. Through RYEL we propose new definitions for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (IAI) in a much better way and will help us to cover a technological spectrum that has not yet been covered and promises to be a new area of study which we call Interpretation-Assessment/Assessment-Interpretation (IA-AI) that consists not only in explaining machine inferences but the interpretation and assessment from a user according to a context. It is proposed a new focus-centered organization in which the XAI-IAI will be able to work and will allow us to explain in more detail the method implemented by RYEL. We believe our system has an explanatory and interpretive nature and could be used in other domains of discourse, some examples are: (1) the interpretation a doctor has about a disease and the assessment of using certain medicine, (2) the interpretation a psychologist has from a patient and the assessment for a psychological application treatment, (3) or how a mathematician interprets a real-world problem and makes an assessment about which mathematical formula to use. However, now we focus on the legal domain. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Case-Based Reasoning (CBR); Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI); Explainable legal knowledge representation; Explanatory Graphical Interface (EGI); Granular Computing (GrC); Interpretation-Assessment/Assessment-Interpretation (IA-AI); RYEL",,"Yager, R., Filev, D., Operations for granular computing: Mixing words with numbers (1998) Proceedings of 1998 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, pp. 123-128. , , pp; Zadeh, L., Towards a theory of fuzzy information granulation and its centrality in human reasoning and fuzzy logic (1997) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 19, pp. 111-127; Teerapong, K., Graphical ways of researching.

Privacy remains one of the most elusive concepts used in legal discourse. Apparently it is not possible to define what privacy is, but it is reasonable to indicate situations which are rationally classified as privacy-relevant. In this paper we refine this view by introducing the notion of the frame - a complex knowledge representation structure that integrates the issues of relevance and the issues of classification. We discuss how this proposal may link the classical knowledge-based representation approach with the more recent, quantitative methods for legal text analysis. This paper is a result of the project (Assessing the Impact of Cases in Selected Legal Domains.

In the first part of the paper, we have identified the relevant prior cases and statutes for the provided query using approaches based on BM 25, Topic embeddings and Law2Vec embeddings. For the second part, we used BERT to semantically segment a legal case document into Seven pre-defined labels or ""rhetorical roles"". In the first task, our performance in P@10 and BPREF metrics positioned us in the top 2 ranking spots. On the other hand, our BERT implementation for the second task got us macro precision of .479, which is just .027 lower than the best performing approach. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Bert; Bm25; Classification; Information retrieval; Law; Nlp; Precedent retrieval; Rhetorical role; Statute retrieval; Topic embeddings; Word embeddings","Embeddings; Fires; Information retrieval; Semantics; Legal case; Legal research; Novel methods; Semantic segmentation; Text retrieval; Working papers; Artificial intelligence","Bhattacharya, P., Ghosh, K., Ghosh, S., Pal, A., Mehta, P., Bhattacharya, A., Majumder, P., Overview of the Fire 2020 AILA track: Artificial Intelligence for Legal Assistance (2020) Proc. of FIRE 2020 - Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, , Hyderabad, India, December 16-20; Bhattacharya, P., Ghosh, K., Ghosh, S., Pal, A., Mehta, P., Bhattacharya, A., Majumder, P., Overview of the Fire 2019 AILA track: Artificial Intelligence for Legal Assistance (2019) Proc. of FIRE 2019 - Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, , Kolkata, India, December 12-15; Zhao, Zicheng, FIRE2019@ AILA: Legal Information Retrieval Using Improved BM25 (2019) FIRE, , (Working Notes); Gain, Baban, (2019) IITP in COLIEE@ ICAIL 2019: Legal Information Retrieval using BM25 and BERT; Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) Bert: Pretraining of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805; Bhattacharya, Paheli, Paul, Shounak, Ghosh, Kripabandhu, Ghosh, Saptarshi, Wyner, Adam, Identification of Rhetorical Roles of Sentences in Indian Legal Judgments (2019) Proc.

The automation of legal services cannot be efficiently done without efficiently automating legal reasoning. Legal case-based reasoning (CBR) provides a method of obtaining explainable and strong predictions for legal issues that lawyers would typically predict on the basis of analogy to prior decided cases. Automating explainable predictions with regard to these sorts of legal issues is difficult without resort to CBR. Wider adoption of CBR in the legal realm therefore has the potential to increase the scope of legal services that can be automated. Despite this potential, as of early 2018 there were no open-source or commercially-available tools for building legal case-based reasoning systems. This paper describes an open-source tool named docassemble-openlcbr designed for ease of use by legal professionals in implementing CBR in the development of automated legal services. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Demonstration; Docassemble; Law; Legal case-based reasoning; Open-source; Openlcbr","Automation; Demonstrations; Forecasting; Laws and legislation; Open systems; Docassemble; Legal case; Legal reasoning; Legal services; Open source tools; Open sources; Openlcbr; User friendly; Case based reasoning","Ashley, K.D., (2017) Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analytics, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Ashley, K.D., Briininghaus, S., Automatically classifying case texts and predicting outcomes (2009) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 17 (2), pp. 125-165. , 2009; Grabmair, M., (2018) OpenLCBR, , https://github.com/mgrabmair/openlcbr; (2019) Clio, , https://www.clio.com, Themis Solutions Inc; Morris, J., (2018) Docassemble-openlcbr, , https://github.com/Gauntletl73/docassemble-openlcbr; Pyle, J., (2019) Docassemble, , https://docassemble.org","Morris, J.; University of AlbertaCanada; email: jmorris@ualberta.ca",,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450367547,,,"English","Proc.

However, their integration in web design domain requires certain sophistication, since parts of available solutions cannot be reused directly, due to technical and legal obstacles. This article describes evolutionary algorithm for automatic generation of website designs, which treats parameters of functionality, layout and visual appearance as the variables. The structure of the chromosome is devised, allowing representation of websites’ properties in the above three manipulated aspects and facilitating easy application of the genetic operators. We also describe organization and population of repository of filler-up content, which is compulsory for evaluation of WUI fitness with regard to the needs and preferences of users. We demonstrate retrieval of web designs as cases and propose using similarity measure in the fitness function to adapt the generated WUI to these examples. Finally, implementation of the approach is illustrated based on the popular Drupal web framework. The results of the study can empower case-based reuse of existing web designs and therefore be of interest to both AI researchers and software engineers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Case-based reasoning; Drupal framework; Software engineering; Web user interface design","Case based reasoning; Chromosomes; Computer aided design; Computer software reusability; Software engineering; Web Design; Websites; Automatic Generation; Case-based approach; Drupal framework; Fitness functions; Genetic optimization; Similarity measure; Visual appearance; Web user interface; User interfaces","Anderson, M.R., Brainwash: A data system for feature engineering (2013) CIDR; Bakaev, M., Assessing similarity for case-based web user interface design (2018) Digital Transformation and Global Society.

It is urgently necessary for Japanese judiciary to adopt ICT to catch up with the global trend. For example, since almost all judicial records are stored as printed material, it is difficult to access them. Recently, limited number of record are opened on web site. UI for retrieving is not well designed for ordinary people. For example, they cannot search precedents with thing in action and what to prove to win. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose an intelligent precedent retrieval system that uses ontology. It allows users to find precedents with thing in action and similarity of documents. Also, it suggests appropriate laws and what to prove. In other words, our system can support user’s prosecution. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Civil trial; Cyber court; High tech court; Legal document; Ontology; Precedent retrieval system; Semantic web; XML","Ontology; Semantic Web; System theory; XML; Civil trial; Cyber court; High tech; Legal documents; Retrieval systems; Information retrieval","William & Mary Law School, , http://law.wm.edu/academics/intellectuallife/researchcenters/clct/; Singapore Supreme Court, , http://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=361#10; (2014) JURISIN, p. 2013. , Japan, October; Kasahara, T., Cybercourt - Court technology.

It remains largely based on formal logic, including non-monotonic logic, case-based reasoning, and logic programming. However, some researchers in and practitioners of law have argued in favor of quantitative approaches (e.g. probability) to account for uncertainties in legal arguments. Other researchers have pointed some of the shortcomings of the current artificial intelligence and law research, e.g. inability to take context into account. At the same time, machine learning has made huge inroads in many different fields and applications, and therefore, the question is whether machine learning has anything to offer to the theory, and, equally important, the practice of law. As a position paper, this is a preliminary study towards the exploration of a synergistic integration of current artificial intelligence approaches in law, with machine learning approaches. It puts forward the idea that formal, logic-based approaches, currently very popular the Artificial Intelligence&Law research, could benefit from an extension with a machine learning component, and discusses some ways in which machine learning could be integrated into these approaches.",,"Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Computer circuits; Formal logic; Logic programming; Artificial intelligence and laws; Legal arguments; Logic-based approach; Machine learning approaches; Nonmonotonic logic; Position papers; Quantitative approach; Synergistic integration; Learning systems","Bench-Capon, T., Argument in artificial intelligence and law (1997) Artificial Intelligence and Law, 5 (4), pp. 249-261; Berman, D.H., Hafner, C.D., Representing teleological structure in case-based legal reasoning: The missing link (1993) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 50-59. , ACM; Campbell, W., Li, L., Dagli, C., Greenfield, K., Wolf, E., Campbell, J., (2016) Predicting and Analyzing Factors in Patent Litigation.

But often, people have a specific purpose to their activity that drives the process, that is, they have particular questions that need answering in support of some broader investigation. These questions often change as answers point in various directions during an investigation, whether the investigation is formal (e.g., scientific, legal, journalistic, or military) or simply an informal browsing of the internet. Here we take a mixed-initiative approach to knowledge discovery, and we present a system called Kyudo that supports the process using a conversational case-based reasoning process. Cases in Kyudo are sequences of knowledge goals or questions that form arcs through a multidimensional knowledge space and that form the core activity in a dialogue between the user and system. As the system gains more experience and therefore more cases, it is able to detect similarity in knowledge goals and prompt the user with additional relevant goals that can short circuit the human reasoning process to minimize tangents or false starts. In this paper we present a distance-based mechanism that reduces the total length of a goal trajectory through guidance that accelerates the human reasoning process and AIDS effective knowledge discovery.

A theoretical aim of these models is to understand legal reasoning by simulating it in a computer program, while a practical aim is to study how advanced information technology can aid legal practice. First logical deduction is discussed as a necessary but insufficient component of realistic models of legal reasoning. Then models of defeasible legal reasoning and legal argumentation are discussed, which focus on the generation and comparison of reasons or arguments for and against legal claims. Computational models of legal interpretation emphasize the interplay between rules and cases and the role of principles, purposes, and values. Computational models of legal proof account for the uncertainty in legal proof in three alternative ways: with Bayesian probability theory, argumentation, and narrative. Finally, procedural models of legal reasoning are based on the idea that the quality of a legal decision partly depends on how it was reached. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we discuss how the requirements of argument guide the specification and selection of supporting cases and how an existing case base influences argument formation. Second, we present our evolving taxonomy of patterns of actual legal argument. This taxonomy builds upon our much earlier work on ‘argument moves’ and also on our more recent analysis of how cases are used to support arguments for the interpretation of legal statutes. Third, we show how the theory of argument used by CABARET, a hybrid case-based/rule-based rea-soner. can support many of the argument patterns in our taxonomy. © 1998 Scott Brewer.","Argument; Case-based reasoning; Mixed paradigm; Statutory interpretation",,"Alvarado, S.J., (1990) Understanding Editorial Text: A Computer Model of Argument Comprehension, , Boston.

So the team-members in the design teams range from novices to experts in NPD. The juniors developer in the design project team lack more successful product-design experiences as their seniority and skills. Therefore, those developers always query and search their problems with the limited terminology via the information systems or websites. So the results of the querying and searching always are limited to the similar domain-knowledge. The new product development (NPD) involves multidisciplinary knowledge such as accumulated experiences of knowledge-workers, and different technical and legal documents. The information systems (IS) facilitating the NPD processes often include document-based knowledge management system (KMS), Product Data Management (PDM), Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems etc. With these different systems, novices at various stages of NPD processes often have problems to use the exact and suitable keywords to query the problems from those information systems. The study proposes a case-based reasoning to construct a hierarchical knowledge model to record knowledge-workers' experiences and to store the information of experiences and the recommendation of experts. The aim of the study is that the proposed architecture can query the information scattered in different information systems by using their individual-domain terminology and retrieve the better fitted results of the querying. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Information systems (IS); Knowledge management system (KMS); New product development (NPD); Product data management (PDM); Product lifecycle management (PLM)","Case based reasoning; Information use; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Management information systems; Manufacture; Product design; Product development; Search engines; Terminology; Design experience; Hierarchical knowledge; Knowledge management system; New product development; Product Data Management; Product life cycle management; Product lifecycle management systems; Proposed architectures; Life cycle","Cooper, R.G., Perspective third-generation new product processes (1994) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 11 (1), pp. 3-14; Cooper, R.G., Perspective: The Stage-Gate® Idea-to-Launch Process-Update, What's New, and NexGen Systems (2008) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 25 (3), pp. 213-232; Kolodner, J.L., Maintaining organization in a dynamic long-term memory (1983) Cognitive Science, 7 (4), pp. 243-280; Kolodner, J.L., Reconstructive memory: A computer model (1983) Cognitive Science, 7 (4), pp. 281-328; Kolodner, J.L., (1988) DARPA Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning: Proceedings, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc; Kolodner, J.L., An introduction to case-based reasoning (1992) Artificial Intelligence Review, 6 (1), pp. 3-34; Necib, C., Freytag, J.C., Ontology based query processing in database management systems (2003) On The Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2003: CoopIS, DOA, and ODBASE, pp. 839-857; Necib, C., Freytag, J.C., (2005) Query processing using ontologies","Tsao, Y.-C.No.300, Jhongda Rd, Jhongli City, Taoyuan County 32001, Taiwan; email: tyc6095@ms1.hinet.net",,"Trans Tech Publications Ltd",10226680,9783037855447,,,"English","Adv.

Contemporary Taiwanese legal system inherits this invaluable culture and introduces foreign laws into its legal system. Since dispute board (DB) and the way to enforce its decisions has been widely discussed recently, this article treasures this opportunity to evaluate current mediation statutes in Taiwan and the trend of DB after reviewing relevant methodologies and systems for mediation result and reasoning. Based on available mediation and/or litigation cases, this study attempts to use case-based reasoning (CBR) methodology to predict the possible outcome of a mediation case by finding the similarity between current case and historical cases. The predicted outcome can serve as a reference for making decisions in future mediation process. Finally, some unique features in using such methodology for prediction of mediation decisions are also discussed.","Case-based reasoning; Construction dispute resolution; Dispute board; Mediation","CBr; Construction dispute; Dispute board; Foreign laws; Legal system; Making decision; Mediation; Unique features; Robotics; Laws and legislation","Chen, J., (2003) Litigation Prediction Model for Construction Disputes Caused by Change Orders, , Dissertation of University of Wisconsin at Madison; El-Adaway, H., (2008) Construction Dispute Mitigation Through Multi-agent Based Simulation and Risk Management Modeling, , Dissertation of Iowa State University; Cheng, M., Tsai, C., Chiu, Y., Fuzzy case-based reasoning for coping with construction disputes (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (2 PART 2), pp. 4106-4113. , March; Pulket, T., Arditi, D., Universal prediction model for construction litigation (2009) Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 23 (3), pp. 178-187. , May/June; Mahfouz, T., Kandil, A., Automated outcome prediction model for differing site conditions through support vector machines (2010) Proceedings of the International Conference on Computing in Civil and Building Engineering; 1.3 benefits (2007) DRBF Practices and Procedures, p. 3. , Dispute Resolution Board Foundation DRBF Research April; (2000) Complaint Review for Government Procurement in Taiwan, pp. 39-41. , Public Construction Commission PCC Research; Chau, K.W., Prediction of construction litigation outcome - A case-based reasoning approach (2006) Advances in Applied Artificial Intelligence, 4031, pp. 548-553; (2011) Law and Regulations Retrieving System, , http://jirs.judicial.gov.tw/eng/, The Judicial Yuan of the Republic China","Hwang, C.-Y.; Graduate Institute of Construction Eng. and Management, Taiwan; email: funteng.hwang@gmail.com",,,,,,,"English","Proc.

The SIROCCO (System for Intelligent Retrieval of Operationalized Cases and COdes) program employed a representation for the temporal ordering of events in ethics cases in a way that informed determinations of whether and how ethical norms were violated and if the problem and other cases were normatively analogous at a deeper level. At the same time, the program supported ordinary case enterers in translating the facts of textually described cases into a machine-processable representation. This paper presents these previously unpublished aspects of the work including a report of an empirical evaluation of the contribution of the temporal representation to the program's success in retrieving relevant norms and cases. Although the results were negative, a consideration of the reasons why is illuminating. While SIROCCO dealt with engineering ethics cases, it is clear that similar temporal considerations apply in legal cases and that the approach is likely to be useful in legal narrative representations. © 2011 ACM.","case similarity; narrative case models; representing temporal ordering","AI and law; Case similarity; Empirical evaluations; Engineering ethics; Intelligent retrieval; Legal case; Legal reasoning; narrative case models; Reasoner; Temporal ordering; Temporal representations; Artificial intelligence; Philosophical aspects; Program translators; Automata theory","Allen, J.F., Maintaining Knowledge about Temporal Intervals (1983) Communications of the ACM, 26 (11), pp. 832-843; Ashley, K.D., Ontological Requirements for analogical, teleological and hypothetical reasoning (2009) Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL-09), pp. 1-10. , ACM Press; Ashley, K.D., McLaren, B.M., An AI Investigation of Citation's Epistemological Role (2001) Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference OnArtificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL-01), pp. 32-41. , ACM Press; Berman, D.H., Hafner, C.D., Understanding Precedents in a Temporal Context of Evolving Legal Doctrine (1995) Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL-95), pp. 42-51. , ACM Press; Bex, F., (2009) Evidence for A Good Story: A Hybrid Theory of Arguments, Stories and Criminal Evidence, , PhD Thesis: University of Groningen; Gardner, A.Vd.L., (1987) An Artificial Intelligence Approach to Legal Reasoning, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Governatori, G., Rotolo, A., Riveret, R., Palmirani, M., Sartor, G., Variants of Temporal Defeasible Logics for Modelling Norm Modifications (2007) Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL-07), pp. 155-160. , ACM Press; Hammond, K.J., (1989) Case-Based Planning: Viewing Planning As A MemoryTask, , San Diego, CA: Academic Press, Inc; Hobbs, J.R., Pan, F., An Ontology of Time for the Semantic Web (2004) ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP) - Special Issue on Temporal Information Processing TALIP Homepage Archive, 3 (1). , March 2004; Jaczynski, M., Framework for the Management of Past Experiences with Time-Extended Situations (1997) Proceedings of the Sixth ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '97), Las Vegas, Nevada; Jaczynski, M., Trousse, B., BROADWAY: A World Wide Web Browsing Advisor Reusing Past Navigations from a Group of Users (1998) Proceedings of the Fourth European Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning.

The law is viewed from a perspective of computer science in law. I intend to apply requirements engineering methods in law. The Berman and Hafner's [1993. Representing teleological structure in case based legal reasoning: the missing link. In: Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on AI and Law. ACM Press, New York, pp. 50-59] challenge to model case-based reasoning in legal domain and the more systematic research, which is collected in Artificial Intelligence and Law journal in 2002, are considered as possible approaches to solutions. The term ""goal"" covers purposes, policies, interests, values, etc. I find a formalisation to have different levels depending on a distinct meaning of the term ""law"". E.g., legal drafting is closer to engineering than to legal reasoning. European Union law and implementation of EU directives provide us with court decisions based on the teleological method. National implementation measures could employ goal-driven systems engineering techniques. Conclusions: (1) the formalisation is a challenging problem, (2) experts from other domains will gain from explicit representation of aims behind the law, (3) analysis of the structure of law is not enough; the studies of the content of law are required, too. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The starting point of these interactions occurs when ITS submits a penal situation to Law students. Then, students are expected to learn by means of two fundamental but different skills to solve legal problems. Firstly, they should know how to retrieve relevant cases and Legal concepts about the cases, and secondly, how to use them effectively as examples to justify positions in a Legal argument.","Artificial intelligence and law; Case-based reasoning; Intelligent tutoring system; Rule-based system","Artificial intelligence; Intelligent agents; Knowledge based systems; Laws and legislation; Problem solving; Students; Case based reasoning; Intelligent tutoring system (ITS); Problem based Learning; Rule-based systems; Learning systems","Cláudio Acquaviva, M., (1993) Dicionário Encidopédico do Direito, , São Paulo; Aleven, V., Ashley, K.D., What law students need to know to win (1993) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pp. 115-129. , R.

In these work, we use a set-inclusion based similarity which is a generalization of a similarity measure proposed in a legal domain [Ashley90,Ashley94].
